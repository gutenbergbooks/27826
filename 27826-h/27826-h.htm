<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Many years ago my friend and publisher, Mr. Charles
Longman, presented me with <i>Le Cabinet des F&eacute;es</i> (&lsquo;The
Fairy Cabinet&rsquo;). This work almost requires a swinging
bookcase for its accommodation, like the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i>, and in a revolving bookcase I bestowed the
volumes. Circumstances of an intimately domestic
character, &lsquo;not wholly unconnected,&rsquo; as Mr. Micawber
might have said, with the narrowness of my study (in
which it is impossible to &lsquo;swing a cat&rsquo;), prevent the revolving
bookcase from revolving at this moment. I
can see, however, that the Fairy Cabinet contains at least
forty volumes, and I think there are about sixty in all.
This great plenitude of fairy tales from all quarters
presents legends of fairies, witches, genii or Djinn, monsters,
dragons, wicked step-mothers, princesses, pretty
or plain, princes lucky or unlucky, giants, dwarfs, and
enchantments. The stories begin with those which
children like best&mdash;the old <i>Blue Beard</i>, <i>Puss in Boots</i>,
<i>Hop o&rsquo; my Thumb</i>, <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, <i>The Sleeping
Beauty</i>, and <i>Toads and Pearls</i>. These were first
collected, written, and printed at Paris in 1697. The
author was Monsieur Charles Perrault, a famous personage
in a great <i>perruque</i>, who in his day wrote large
volumes now unread. He never dreamed that he was
to be remembered mainly by the shabby little volume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span>
with the tiny headpiece pictures&mdash;how unlike the
fairy way of drawing by Mr. Ford, said to be known
as &lsquo;Over-the-wall Ford&rsquo; among authors who play
cricket, because of the force with which he swipes!
Perrault picked up the rustic tales which the nurse of
his little boy used to tell, and he told them again in his
own courtly, witty way. They do not seem to have
been translated into English until nearly thirty years later,
when they were published in English, with the French
on the opposite page, by a Mr. Pote, a bookseller at
Eton. Probably the younger Eton boys learned as
much French as they condescended to acquire from these
fairy tales, which are certainly more amusing than
the <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i> of Messire Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac de la
Motte-F&eacute;nelon, tutor of the children of France, Archbishop
Duke of Cambrai, and Prince of the Holy Roman
Empire.</p>

<p>The success of Perrault was based on the pleasure
which the court of Louis XIV. took in fairy tales; we
know that they were told among Court ladies, from a
letter of Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;. Naturally, Perrault had
imitators, such as Madame d&rsquo;Aulnoy, a wandering lady
of more wit than reputation. To her we owe <i>Beauty
and the Beast</i> and <i>The Yellow Dwarf</i>. Anthony Hamilton
tried his hand with <i>The Ram</i>, a story too prolix and confused,
best remembered for the remark, &lsquo;Ram, my friend,
begin at the beginning!&rsquo; Indeed, the narrative style
of the Ram is lacking in lucidity! Then came <i>The
Arabian Nights</i>, translated by Monsieur Galland. Nobody
has translated <i>The Arabian Nights</i> so well as Galland.
His is the reverse of a scientific rendering, but
it is as pleasantly readable as the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>
would be if Alexandre Dumas had kept his promise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg&nbsp;vii]</a></span>
translate Homer. Galland omitted the verses and a
great number of passages which nobody would miss,
though the anthropologist is supposed to find them valuable
and instructive in later scientific translations which
do not amuse. Later, Persian Tales, Tales of the Sea,
and original inventions, more or less on the fairy model,
were composed by industrious men and women. They
are far too long&mdash;are novels, indeed, and would please
no child or mature person of taste. All these were
collected in the vast Fairy Cabinet, published in 1786,
just before the Revolution. Probably their attempt
to be simple charmed a society which was extremely artificial,
talked about &lsquo;the simple life&rsquo; and the &lsquo;state of
nature,&rsquo; and was on the eve of a revolution in which human
nature revealed her most primitive traits in orgies of
blood.</p>

<p>That was the end of the Court and of the Court Fairy
Tales, and just when they were demolished, learned men
like the Grimms and Sir Walter Scott began to take an
interest in the popular tales of peasants and savages all
the world over. All the world over the tales were found
to be essentially the same things. <i>Cinderella</i> is everywhere;
a whole book has been written on <i>Cinderella</i> by
Miss Cox, and a very good book it is, but not interesting
to children. For them the best of the collections
of foreign fairy tales are the German stories by the Grimms,
the <i>Tales from the Norse</i>, by Sir G. W. Dasent, (which some
foolish &lsquo;grown-ups&rsquo; denounced as &lsquo;improper&rsquo;), and Miss
Frere&rsquo;s Indian stories. There are hundreds of collections
of savage and peasant fairy tales, but, though many
of these are most interesting, especially Bishop Callaway&rsquo;s
Zulu stories (with the Zulu versions), these do not
come in the way of parents and uncles, and therefore do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</a></span>
not come in the way of children. It is my wish that
children should be allowed to choose their own books.
Let their friends give them the money and turn them
loose in the book shops! They know their own tastes,
and if the children are born bookish, while their dear
parents are the reverse, (and this does occur!), then the
children make the better choice. They are unaffected
in their selections; some want Shakespeares of their own,
and some prefer a volume entitled <i>Buster Brown</i>. A
few&mdash;alas, how few!&mdash;are fond of poetry; a still smaller
number are fond of history. &lsquo;We know that there are
no fairies, but history stories are <em>true</em>!&rsquo; say these little innocents.
I am not so sure that there are no fairies, and
I am only too well aware that the best &lsquo;history stories&rsquo;
are not true.</p>

<p>What children do love is ghost stories. &lsquo;Tell us a
ghost story!&rsquo; they cry, and I am able to meet the demand,
with which I am in sincere sympathy. Only strong
control prevents me from telling the last true ghost story
which I heard yesterday. It would suit children excellently
well. &lsquo;The Grey Ghost Story Book&rsquo; would be a
favourite. At a very early age I read a number of advertisements
of books, and wept because I could not buy
dozens of them, and somebody gave me a book on Botany!
It looked all right, nicely bound in green cloth, but
within it was full of all manner of tediousness.</p>

<p>In our Fairy Cabinet, which cannot extend to sixty
volumes, we have aimed at pleasing children, not &lsquo;grown-ups,&rsquo;
at whom the old French writers directed their romances,
but have hunted for fairy tales in all quarters,
not in Europe alone. In this volume we open, thanks to
Dr. Ignaz K&uuml;nos, with a story from the Turks. &lsquo;Little
King Loc&rsquo; is an original invention by M. Anatole France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg&nbsp;ix]</a></span>
which he very kindly permitted Mrs. Lang to adapt from
<i>L&rsquo;Abeille</i>.</p>

<p>Major Campbell, as previously, tells tales which he
collected among the natives of India. But the sources
are usually named at the end of each story, and when
they are not named children will not miss them. Mrs.
Lang, except in cases mentioned, has translated and adapted
to the conditions of young readers the bulk of the collection,
and Mrs. Skovgaard-Pedersen has done &lsquo;The Green
Knight&rsquo; from the Danish. I must especially thank Monsieur
Macler for permitting us to use some of his <i>Contes
Arm&eacute;niens</i> (Paris: Ernest Leroux, Editeur).</p>

<h2><i>MADSCHUN</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived, in a small cottage among
some hills, a woman with her son, and, to her great grief,
the young man, though hardly more than twenty years of
age, had not as much hair on his head as a baby. But, old
as he looked, the youth was very idle, and whatever trade
his mother put him to he refused to work, and in a few
days always came home again.</p>

<p>On a fine summer morning he was lying as usual half
asleep in the little garden in front of the cottage when the
sultan&rsquo;s daughter came riding by, followed by a number
of gaily dressed ladies. The youth lazily raised himself
on his elbow to look at her, and that one glance changed his
whole nature.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will marry her and nobody else,&rsquo; he thought. And
jumping up, he went to find his mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must go at once to the sultan, and tell him that I
want his daughter for my wife,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">What?</span>&rsquo; shouted the old woman, shrinking back into a
corner, for nothing but sudden madness could explain such
an amazing errand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? You must go at once to the
sultan and tell him that I want his daughter for my wife,&rsquo;
repeated the youth impatiently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;but, do you know what you are saying?&rsquo; stammered
the mother. &lsquo;You will learn no trade, and have
only the five gold pieces left you by your father, and can
you really expect that the sultan would give his daughter
to a penniless bald-pate like you?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
&lsquo;That is <em>my</em> affair; do as I bid you.&rsquo; And neither day
nor night did her son cease tormenting her, till, in despair,
she put on her best clothes, and wrapped her veil about her,
and went over the hill to the palace.</p>

<p>It was the day that the sultan set apart for hearing
the complaints and petitions of his people, so the
woman found no difficulty in gaining admission to his
presence.</p>

<img src="images/ofb04.jpg" width="500" height="428"
alt="The youth sees the sultan&#39;s daughter riding by"
title="Love at first sight" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Do not think me mad, O Excellency,&rsquo; she began,
&lsquo;though I know I must seem like it. But I have a son
who, since his eyes have rested on the veiled face of the
princess, has not left me in peace day or night till I consented
to come to the palace, and to ask your Excellency
for your daughter&rsquo;s hand. It was in vain I answered that
my head might pay the forfeit of my boldness, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
listen to nothing. Therefore am I here; do with me even
as you will!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the sultan always loved anything out of the common,
and this situation was new indeed. So, instead of
ordering the trembling creature to be flogged or cast into
prison, as some other sovereigns might have done, he merely
said: &lsquo;Bid your son come hither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old woman stared in astonishment at such a reply.
But when the sultan repeated his words even more gently
than before, and did not look in anywise angered, she took
courage, and bowing again she hastened homeward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, how have you sped?&rsquo; asked her son eagerly as she
crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are to go up to the palace without delay, and
speak to the sultan himself,&rsquo; replied the mother. And
when he heard the good news, his face lightened up
so wonderfully that his mother thought what a pity it
was that he had no hair, as then he would be quite handsome.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, the lightning will not fly more swiftly,&rsquo; cried he.
And in another instant he was out of her sight.</p>

<p>When the sultan beheld the bald head of his daughter&rsquo;s
wooer, he no longer felt in the mood for joking, and resolved
that he must somehow or other shake himself free
of such an unwelcome lover. But as he had summoned
the young man to the palace, he could hardly dismiss him
without a reason, so he hastily said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hear you wish to marry my daughter? Well and
good. But the man who is to be her husband must first
collect all the birds in the world, and bring them into the
gardens of the palace; for hitherto no birds have made their
homes in the trees.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man was filled with despair at the sultan&rsquo;s
words. How was he to snare all these birds? and even
if he <em>did</em> succeed in catching them it would take years
to carry them to the palace! Still, he was too proud to
let the sultan think that he had given up the princess without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
a struggle, so he took a road that led past the palace and
walked on, not noticing whither he went.</p>

<p>In this manner a week slipped by, and at length he found
himself crossing a desert with great rocks scattered here
and there. In the shadow cast by one of these was seated
a holy man or dervish, as he was called, who motioned to
the youth to sit beside him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Something is troubling you, my son,&rsquo; said the holy man;
&lsquo;tell me what it is, as I may be able to help you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;O, my father,&rsquo; answered the youth, &lsquo;I wish to marry
the princess of my country; but the sultan refuses to give
her to me unless I can collect all the birds in the world and
bring them into his garden. And how can I, or any other
man, do that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not despair,&rsquo; replied the dervish, &lsquo;it is not so difficult
as it sounds. Two days&rsquo; journey from here, in
the path of the setting sun, there stands a cypress tree,
larger than any other cypress that grows upon the earth.
Sit down where the shadow is darkest, close to the trunk,
and keep very still. By-and-by you will hear a mighty
rushing of wings, and all the birds in the world will come
and nestle in the branches. Be careful not to make a
sound till everything is quiet again, and then say
&ldquo;Madschun!&rdquo; At that the birds will be forced to remain
where they are&mdash;not one can move from its perch; and
you will be able to place them all over your head and arms
and body, and in this way you must carry them to the
sultan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a glad heart the young man thanked the dervish,
and paid such close heed to his directions that, a few
days later, a strange figure covered with soft feathers
walked into the presence of the sultan. The princess&rsquo;s
father was filled with surprise, for never had he seen
such a sight before. Oh! how lovely were those little
bodies, and bright frightened eyes! Soon a gentle stirring
was heard, and what a multitude of wings unfolded themselves:
blue wings, yellow wings, red wings, green wings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
And when the young man whispered &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; they first
flew in circles round the sultan&rsquo;s head, and then disappeared
through the open window, to choose homes in
the garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<a name="birds_brought" id="birds_brought"></a>
<img src="images/ofb05.jpg" width="468" height="500"
alt="The youth bows before the sultan, as birds fly around him"
title="How the birds were brought to the sultan" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I have done your bidding, O Sultan, and now give
me the princess,&rsquo; said the youth. And the sultan answered
hurriedly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes! oh, yes! you have pleased me well! Only one
thing remains to turn you into a husband that any girl
might desire. That head of yours, you know&mdash;it is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
<em>very</em> bald! Get it covered with nice thick curly hair, and
<em>then</em> I will give you my daughter. You are so clever that
I am sure this will give you no trouble at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Silently the young man listened to the sultan&rsquo;s words,
and silently he sat in his mother&rsquo;s kitchen for many days
to come, till, one morning, the news reached him that the
sultan had betrothed his daughter to the son of the wizir,
and that the wedding was to be celebrated without delay
in the palace. With that he arose in wrath, and made
his way quickly and secretly to a side door, used only by
the workmen who kept the building in repair, and, unseen
by anyone, he made his way into the mosque, and then
entered the palace by a gallery which opened straight into
the great hall. Here the bride and bridegroom and two
or three friends were assembled, waiting for the appearance
of the sultan for the contract to be signed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Madschun!&rsquo; whispered the youth from above. And
instantly everyone remained rooted to the ground; and
some messengers whom the sultan had sent to see that all
was ready shared the same fate.</p>

<p>At length, angry and impatient, the sultan went down to
behold with his own eyes what had happened, but as nobody
could give him any explanation, he bade one of his
attendants to fetch a magician, who dwelt near one of the
city gates, to remove the spell which had been cast by some
evil genius.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is your own fault,&rsquo; said the magician, when he had
heard the sultan&rsquo;s story. &lsquo;If you had not broken your
promise to the young man, your daughter would not have
had this ill befall her. Now there is only one remedy, and
the bridegroom you have chosen must yield his place to the
bald-headed youth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sore though he was in his heart, the sultan knew that
the magician was wiser than he, and despatched his most
trusted servants to seek out the young man without a
moment&rsquo;s delay and bring him to the palace. The youth,
who all this time had been hiding behind a pillar, smiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
to himself when he heard these words, and, hastening home,
he said to his mother: &lsquo;If messengers from the sultan should
come here and ask for me, be sure you answer that it is a
long while since I went away, and that you cannot tell
where I may be, but that if they will give you money
enough for your journey, as you are very poor, you will do
your best to find me.&rsquo; Then he hid himself in the loft
above, so that he could listen to all that passed.</p>

<p>The next minute someone knocked loudly at the door,
and the old woman jumped up and opened it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is your bald-headed son here?&rsquo; asked the man outside.
&lsquo;If so, let him come with me, as the sultan wishes to speak
with him directly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas! sir,&rsquo; replied the woman, putting a corner of her
veil to her eyes, &lsquo;he left me long since, and since that day
no news of him has reached me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! good lady, can you not guess where he may be?
The sultan intends to bestow on him the hand of his daughter,
and he is certain to give a large reward to the man
who brings him back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He never told me whither he was going,&rsquo; answered
the crone, shaking her head. &lsquo;But it is a great honour
that the sultan does him, and well worth some trouble.
There <em>are</em> places where, perhaps, he may be found, but
they are known to me only, and I am a poor woman and
have no money for the journey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! that will not stand in the way,&rsquo; cried the man.
&lsquo;In this purse are a thousand gold pieces; spend them
freely. Tell me where I can find him and you shall have as
many more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it is a bargain; and now farewell,
for I must make some preparations; but in a few days at
furthest you shall hear from me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For nearly a week both the old woman and her son were
careful not to leave the house till it was dark, lest they
should be seen by any of the neighbours, and as they did
not even kindle a fire or light a lantern, everyone supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
that the cottage was deserted. At length one fine morning,
the young man got up early and dressed himself, and put
on his best turban, and after a hasty breakfast took the
road to the palace.</p>

<p>The huge negro before the door evidently expected him,
for without a word he let him pass, and another attendant
who was waiting inside conducted him straight into the
presence of the sultan, who welcomed him gladly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, my son! where have you hidden yourself all this
time?&rsquo; said he. And the bald-headed man answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sultan! Fairly I won your daughter, but you
broke your word, and would not give her to me. Then
my home grew hateful to me, and I set out to wander
through the world! But now that you have repented
of your ill-faith, I have come to claim the wife who is
mine of right. Therefore bid your wizir prepare the contract.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So a fresh contract was prepared, and at the wish of
the new bridegroom was signed by the sultan and the
wizir in the chamber where they met. After this was
done, the youth begged the sultan to lead him to the princess,
and together they entered the big hall, where everyone
was standing exactly as they were when the young man had
uttered the fatal word.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can you remove the spell?&rsquo; asked the sultan anxiously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; replied the young man (who, to say the
truth, was a little anxious himself), and stepping forward,
he cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let the victims of Madschun be free!&rsquo;</p>

<p>No sooner were the words uttered than the statues
returned to life, and the bride placed her hand joyfully
in that of her new bridegroom. As for the old one, he
vanished completely, and no one ever knew what became
of him.</p>

<h2><i>THE BLUE PARROT</i></h2>


<p>In a part of Arabia where groves of palms and sweet-scented
flowers give the traveller rest after toilsome
journeys under burning skies, there reigned a young king
whose name was Lino. He had grown up under the
wise rule of his father, who had lately died, and though
he was only nineteen, he did not believe, like many young
men, that he must change all the laws in order to show
how clever he was, but was content with the old ones which
had made the people happy and the country prosperous.
There was only one fault that his subjects had to
find with him, and that was that he did not seem in any
hurry to be married, in spite of the prayers that they frequently
offered him.</p>

<p>The neighbouring kingdom was governed by the Swan
fairy, who had an only daughter, the Princess Hermosa,
who was as charming in her way as Lino in his. The
Swan fairy always had an ambassador at the young
king&rsquo;s court, and on hearing the grumbles of the citizens
that Lino showed no signs of taking a wife, the good
man resolved that <em>he</em> would try his hand at match-making.
&lsquo;For,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if there is any one living
who is worthy of the Princess Hermosa he is to be
found here. At any rate, I can but try and bring them
together.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, of course, it was not proper to offer the princess
in marriage, and the difficulty was to work upon the unconscious
king so as to get the proposal to come from
<em>him</em>. But the ambassador was well used to the ways of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
courts, and after several conversations on the art of
painting, which Lino loved, he led the talk to portraits,
and mentioned carelessly that a particularly fine picture
had lately been made of his own princess. &lsquo;Though, as
for a likeness,&rsquo; he concluded, &lsquo;perhaps it is hardly as
good as this small miniature, which was painted a year
ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king took it, and looked at it closely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he sighed, &lsquo;that must be flattered! It cannot
be possible that any woman should be such a miracle of
beauty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you could only see her,&rsquo; answered the ambassador.</p>

<p>The king did not reply, but the ambassador was not at
all surprised when, the following morning, he was sent for
into the royal presence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Since you showed me that picture,&rsquo; began Lino,
almost before the door was shut, &lsquo;I have not been able to
banish the face of the princess from my thoughts. I have
summoned you here to inform you that I am about to send
special envoys to the court of the Swan fairy, asking her
daughter in marriage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot, as you will understand, speak for my mistress
in so important a matter,&rsquo; replied the ambassador,
stroking his beard in order to conceal the satisfaction he
felt. &lsquo;But I know that she will certainly be highly gratified
at your proposal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If that is so,&rsquo; cried the king, his whole face beaming
with joy, &lsquo;then, instead of sending envoys, I will go myself,
and take you with me. In three days my preparations
will be made, and we will set out.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Unluckily for Lino, he had for his neighbour on the
other side a powerful magician named Ismenor, who was
king of the Isle of Lions, and the father of a hideous
daughter, whom he thought the most beautiful creature
that ever existed. Riquette, for such was her name, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
also fallen in love with a portrait, but it was of King Lino,
and she implored her father to give him to her for a husband.
Ismenor, who considered that no man lived
who was worthy of his treasure, was about to send his
chief minister to King Lino on this mission, when the
news reached him that the king had already started for
the court of the Swan fairy. Riquette was thrown into
transports of grief, and implored her father to prevent
the marriage, which Ismenor promised to do; and calling
for an ugly and humpbacked little dwarf named Rabot,
he performed some spells which transported them quickly
to a rocky valley through which the king and his escort
were bound to pass. When the tramp of horses was
heard, the magician took out an enchanted handkerchief,
which rendered invisible any one who touched it. Giving
one end to Rabot, and holding the other himself, they
walked unseen amongst the horsemen, but not a trace of
Lino was to be found. And this was natural enough,
because the king, tired out with the excitement and
fatigue of the last few days, had bidden the heavy
coaches, laden with presents for the princess, to go
forwards, while he rested under the palms with a few of
his friends. Here Ismenor beheld them, all sound asleep;
and casting a spell which prevented their waking till he
wished them to do so, he stripped the king of all his clothes
and dressed him in those of Rabot, whom he touched with
his ring, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take the shape of Lino until you have wedded the
daughter of the Swan fairy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so great was the magician&rsquo;s power that Rabot
positively believed himself to be really the king!</p>

<p>When the groom had mounted Lino&rsquo;s horse, and had
ridden out of sight, Ismenor aroused the king, who stared
with astonishment at the dirty garments in which he
was dressed; but before he had time to look about him,
the magician caught him up in a cloud, and carried him
off to his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
Meantime Rabot had come up with the others, who
never guessed for a moment that he was not their own
master.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am hungry,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;give me something to eat at
once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;May it please your majesty,&rsquo; answered the steward,
&lsquo;the tents are not even set up, and it will be at least an hour
before your supper is served! We thought&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who taught you to think?&rsquo; interrupted the false king
rudely. &lsquo;You are nothing but a fool! Get me some horse&rsquo;s
flesh directly&mdash;it is the best meat in the world!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The steward could hardly believe his ears. King
Lino, the most polite man under the sun, to speak to his
faithful servant in such a manner! And to want horse&rsquo;s
flesh too! Why he was so delicate in his appetite that
he lived mostly on fruit and cakes. Well, well, there
was no knowing what people would come to; and, anyhow,
he must obey at once, if he wished to keep his head
on his shoulders. Perhaps, after all, it was love which had
driven him mad, and, if so, by-and-by he might come right
again.</p>

<p>Whatever excuses his old servants might invent for
their master, by the time the procession reached the
Swan&rsquo;s fairy capital there were no more horses left, and
they were forced to walk up to the palace on foot. Hiding
their surprise as best they could, they begged the king to
follow them, dismounting from their own horses, as he,
they supposed, preferred to walk. They soon perceived
the Swan fairy and her daughter awaiting them on a low
balcony, under which the king stopped.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you may be surprised that I have
come to ask your daughter&rsquo;s hand in so unceremonious a
fashion; but the journey is long, and I was hungry and ate
my horse, which is the best meat in the world; and I forced
my courtiers to eat theirs also. But for all that I am a
great king, and wish to be your son-in-law. And now that is
settled, where is Hermosa?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; answered the queen, not a little displeased as
well as amazed at the king&rsquo;s manner, which was so
different from anything she had been led to expect.
&lsquo;You possess my daughter&rsquo;s portrait, and it can have made
but little impression on you if you don&rsquo;t recognise her at
once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember any portrait,&rsquo; replied Rabot; &lsquo;but
perhaps it may be in my pocket after all.&rsquo; And he searched
everywhere, while the ladies-in-waiting looked on with
astonishment, but of course found nothing. When he had
finished he turned to the princess, who stood there blushing
and angry, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it is you whom I have come to marry, I think you are
very beautiful, and I am sure if I had even seen your portrait
I should have remembered it. Let us have the wedding
as soon as possible; and, meantime, I should like to go to
sleep, for your country is very different from mine, and I
can assure you that after walking over stones and sand for
days and days one needs a little rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And without waiting for a reply he bade one of the
pages conduct him to his room, where he was soon snoring
so loud that he could be heard at the other end of the
town.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of their sight the poor princess
flung herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms, and burst into tears.
For fifteen days she had had King Lino&rsquo;s portrait constantly
before her, while the letter from their own ambassador
speaking of the young man&rsquo;s grace and charm
had never left her pocket. True, the portrait was faithful
enough, but how could that fair outside contain so
rough and rude a soul? Yet this even she might have
forgiven had the king shown any of the signs of love and
admiration to which she had been so long accustomed. As
for her mother, the poor Swan fairy was so bewildered at
the extraordinary manners of her new son-in-law, that she
was almost speechless.</p>

<p>Matters were in this state when King Lino&rsquo;s chamberlain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
begged for a private audience of her majesty, and no
sooner were they alone than he told her that he feared that
his master had suddenly gone mad, or had fallen under the
spell of some magician.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I had been lost in astonishment before,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but
now that he has failed to recognise the princess, and no
longer possesses her portrait, which he never would part
from for a single instant, my amazement knows no
bounds. Perhaps, madam, your fairy gifts may be able
to discover the reason of this change in one whose courtesy
was the talk of the kingdom.&rsquo; And with a low bow he took
his departure.</p>

<p>The queen stood where the chamberlain left her,
thinking deeply. Suddenly her face cleared, and going
to an old chest which she kept in a secret room, she drew
from it a small mirror. In this mirror she could see faithfully
reflected whatever she wished, and at this moment
she desired above all things to behold King Lino <em>as he really
was</em>.</p>

<p>Ah! the chamberlain was right! It was not he who
was lying on his bed snoring till the whole palace shook
beneath him. No, <em>this</em> was her real son-in-law&mdash;the
man dressed in dirty clothes, and imprisoned in one of
Ismenor&rsquo;s strongest towers, and kissing the portrait of
Hermosa, which had escaped the wizard&rsquo;s notice, owing
to the young king having worn it, for better concealment,
tied amongst his hair. Calling hastily to her daughter,
she bade her also look, and Hermosa had the pleasure of
gazing on Lino, who was behaving exactly as she could
have wished. The mirror was still in her hand when
the door of the prison opened, and there entered the hideous
Riquette, who, from her upraised eyes, seemed to be
begging from Lino some favour which he refused to grant.
Of course Hermosa and her mother could not hear their
words, but from Riquette&rsquo;s angry face as she left the room,
it was not difficult to guess what had happened. But the
mirror had more to tell, for it appeared that in fury at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
rejection by the king, Riquette had ordered four strong
men to scourge him till he fainted, which was done
in the sight of Hermosa, who in horror dropped the mirror,
and would have fallen, had she not been caught by her
mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Control yourself, my child,&rsquo; said the fairy. &lsquo;We have
need of all our wits if we are to rescue the king from the
power of those wicked people. And first it is necessary
to know who the man that has taken his name and his face
really is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then, picking up the mirror, she wished that she might
behold the false lover; and the glass gave back a vision of
a dirty, greasy groom, lying, dressed as he was, on her bed
of state.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So this is the trick Ismenor hoped to play us!
Well, we will have our revenge, whatever it costs us to
get it. Only we must be very careful not to let him guess
that he has not deceived us, for his skill in magic is greater
than mine, and I shall have to be very prudent. To begin
with, I must leave you, and if the false king asks why,
then answer that I have to settle some affairs on the
borders of my kingdom. Meanwhile, be sure you treat
him most politely, and arrange f&ecirc;tes to amuse him.
If he shows any sign of being suspicious, you can even
give him to understand that, on your marriage, I intend
to give up the crown to your husband. And now farewell!&rsquo;
So saying, the Swan fairy waved her hand, and a
cloud came down and concealed her, and nobody imagined
that the beautiful white cloud that was blown so rapidly
across the sky was the chariot that was carrying the Swan
fairy to the tower of Ismenor.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Now the tower was situated in the midst of a forest,
so the queen thought that, under cover of the dark trees,
it would be quite easy for her to drop to earth unseen.
But the tower was so thoroughly enchanted that the
more she tried to reach the ground the tighter something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
tried to hold her back. At length, by putting forth all
the power she possessed, she managed to descend to the
foot of the tower, and there, weak and faint as she was
with her exertions, she lost no time in working her
spells, and found that she could only overcome Ismenor
by means of a stone from the ring of Gyges. But how
was she to get this ring? for the magic book told her that
Ismenor guarded it night and day among his most
precious treasures. However, get it she must, and in
the meantime the first step was to see the royal prisoner
himself. So, drawing out her tablets, she wrote as
follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="swallows_note" id="swallows_note"></a>
<img src="images/ofb07.jpg" width="500" height="459"
alt="The swallow brings the note to Lino" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;The bird which brings you this letter is the Swan fairy,
mother of Hermosa, who loves you as much as you love
her!&rsquo; And after this assurance, she related the wicked
plot of which he had been the victim. Then, quickly
changing herself into a swallow, she began to fly round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
the tower, till she discovered the window of Lino&rsquo;s
prison. It was so high up that bars seemed needless,
especially as four soldiers were stationed in the passage
outside, therefore the fairy was able to enter, and even
to hop on his shoulder, but he was so much occupied with
gazing at the princess&rsquo;s portrait that it was some time before
she could attract his attention. At last she gently
scratched his cheek with the corner of the note, and he
looked round with a start. On perceiving the swallow
he knew at once that help had come, and tearing open
the letter, he wept with joy on seeing the words it contained,
and asked a thousand questions as to Hermosa,
which the swallow was unable to answer, though, by repeated
nods, she signed to him to read further. &lsquo;Must I
indeed pretend to wish to marry that horrible Riquette?&rsquo;
he cried, when he had finished. &lsquo;Can I obtain the stone
from the magician?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the next morning, when Riquette paid
him her daily visit, he received her much more graciously
than usual. The magician&rsquo;s daughter could not contain
her delight at this change, and in answer to her expressions
of joy, Lino told her that he had had a dream by
which he had learned the inconstancy of Hermosa; also
that a fairy had appeared and informed him that if he
wished to break the bonds which bound him to the faithless
princess and transfer his affections to the daughter
of Ismenor, he must have in his possession for a day and
a night a stone from the ring of Gyges, now in the possession
of the magician. This news so enchanted Riquette,
that she flung her arms round the king&rsquo;s neck and embraced
him tenderly, greatly to his disgust, as he would
infinitely have preferred the sticks of the soldiers. However,
there was no help for it, and he did his best to seem
pleased, till Riquette relieved him by announcing that she
must lose no time in asking her father and obtaining from
him the precious stone.</p>

<p>His daughter&rsquo;s request came as a great surprise to Ismenor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
whose suspicions were instantly excited; but, think as he
would, he could not see any means by which the king, so
closely guarded, might have held communication with
the Swan fairy. Still, he would do nothing hastily, and,
hiding his dismay, he told Riquette that his only wish was
to make her happy, and that as she wished so much for
the stone he would fetch it for her. Then he went into
the closet where all his spells were worked, and in a short
time he discovered that his enemy the Swan fairy was at
that moment inside his palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So that is it!&rsquo; he said, smiling grimly. &lsquo;Well, she shall
have a stone by all means, but a stone that will turn everyone
who touches it into marble.&rsquo; And placing a small
ruby in a box, he returned to his daughter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here is the talisman which will gain you the love of
King Lino,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but be sure you give him the box
unopened, or else the stone will lose all its virtue.&rsquo; With
a cry of joy Riquette snatched the box from his hands,
and ran off to the prison, followed by her father, who,
holding tightly the enchanted handkerchief, was able,
unseen, to watch the working of the spell. As he
expected, at the foot of the tower stood the Swan fairy,
who had had the imprudence to appear in her natural
shape, waiting for the stone which the prince was to throw
to her. Eagerly she caught the box as it fell from the
prince&rsquo;s hands, but no sooner had her fingers touched the
ruby, than a curious hardening came over her, her limbs
stiffened, and her tongue could hardly utter the words &lsquo;We
are betrayed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, you <em>are</em> betrayed,&rsquo; cried Ismenor, in a terrible
voice; &lsquo;and <em>you</em>,&rsquo; he continued, dragging the king to the
window, &lsquo;you shall turn into a parrot, and a parrot you will
remain until you can persuade Hermosa to crush in your
head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had hardly finished before a blue parrot flew out
into the forest; and the magician, mounting in his winged
chariot, set off for the Isle of Swans, where he changed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
everybody into statues, exactly in the positions in which
he found them, not even excepting Rabot himself. Only
Hermosa was spared, and her he ordered to get into his
chariot beside him. In a few minutes he reached the
Forest of Wonders, when the magician got down, and
dragged the unhappy princess out after him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have changed your mother into a stone, and your
lover into a parrot,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and you are to become a tree,
and a tree you will remain until you have crushed the head
of the person you love best in the world. But I will leave
you your mind and memory, that your tortures may be increased
a thousand-fold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Great magician as he was, Ismenor could not have invented
a more terrible fate had he tried for a hundred
years. The hours passed wearily by for the poor princess,
who longed for a wood-cutter&rsquo;s axe to put an end to her
misery. How were they to be delivered from their doom?
And even supposing that King Lino <em>did</em> fly that way, there
were thousands of blue parrots in the forest, and how was
she to know him, or he her? As to her mother&mdash;ah! that
was too bad to think about! So, being a woman, she kept
on thinking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the blue parrot flew about the world,
making friends wherever he went, till, one day, he entered
the castle of an old wizard who had just married a
beautiful young wife. Grenadine, for such was her
name, led a very dull life, and was delighted to have a
playfellow, so she gave him a golden cage to sleep in,
and delicious fruits to eat. Only in one way did he
disappoint her&mdash;he never would talk as other parrots
did.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you only knew how happy it would make me, I&rsquo;m
sure you would try,&rsquo; she was fond of saying; but the parrot
did not seem to hear her.</p>

<p>One morning, however, she left the room to gather
some flowers, and the parrot, finding himself alone,
hopped to the table, and, picking up a pencil, wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
some verses on a piece of paper. He had just finished
when he was startled by a noise, and letting fall the pencil,
he flew out of the window.</p>

<p>Now hardly had he dropped the pencil when the wizard
lifted a corner of the curtain which hung over the
doorway, and advanced into the room. Seeing a paper
on the table, he picked it up, and great was his surprise as
he read:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Fair princess, to win your grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I will hold discourse with you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence, though, were more in place<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than chatt&rsquo;ring like a cockatoo.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I half suspected it was enchanted,&rsquo; murmured the
wizard to himself. And he fetched his books and searched
them, and found that instead of being a parrot, the bird
was really a king who had fallen under the wrath of
a magician, and that magician the man whom the
wizard hated most in the world. Eagerly he read on,
seeking for some means of breaking the enchantment, and
at last, to his great joy, he discovered the remedy. Then
he hurried to his wife, who was lying on some cushions
under the tree on which the parrot had perched, and informed
her that her favourite was really the king of a great
country, and that, if she would whistle for the bird, they
would all go together to a certain spot in the Forest of
Marvels, &lsquo;where I will restore him to his own shape. Only
you must not be afraid or cry out, whatever I do,&rsquo; added
he, &lsquo;or everything will be spoilt.&rsquo; The wizard&rsquo;s wife jumped
up in an instant, so delighted was she, and began to whistle
the song that the parrot loved; but as he did not wish it
to be known that he had been listening to the conversation
he waited until she had turned her back, when he
flew down the tree and alighted on her shoulder. Then
they got into a golden boat, which carried them to a clearing
in the forest, where three tall trees stood by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
&lsquo;I want these trees for my magic fire,&rsquo; he said to his
wife; &lsquo;put the parrot on that branch, he will be quite safe,
and go yourself to a little distance. If you stay too near
you may get your head crushed in their fall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At these words the parrot suddenly remembered the
prophecy of Ismenor, and held himself ready, his heart
beating at the thought that in one of those trees he beheld
Hermosa. Meanwhile the magician took a spade, and
loosened the earth of the roots of the three trees so that they
might fall all together. Directly the parrot observed them
totter he spread his wings and flew right under the middle
one, which was the most beautiful of the three. There
was a crash, then Lino and Hermosa stood facing each
other, clasped hand in hand.</p>

<p>After the first few moments, the princess&rsquo;s thoughts
turned to her mother, and falling at the feet of the magician,
who was smiling with delight at the success of his plan, she
implored him to help them once more, and to give the Swan
fairy back her proper shape.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is not so easy,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but I will try what I
can do.&rsquo; And transporting himself to his palace to obtain
a little bottle of poisoned water, he waited till nightfall,
and started at once for Ismenor&rsquo;s tower. Of course, had
Ismenor consulted his books he would have seen what
his enemy was doing, he might have protected himself;
but he had been eating and drinking too much, and had
gone to bed, sleeping heavily. Changing himself into a
bat, the magician flew into the room, and hiding himself
in the curtains, he poured all the liquid over Ismenor&rsquo;s
face, so that he died without a groan. At the same instant
the Swan fairy became a woman again, for no magician,
however powerful, can work spells which last beyond his
own life.</p>

<p>So when the Swan fairy returned to her capital she
found all her courtiers waiting at the gate to receive her,
and in their midst, beaming with happiness, Hermosa and
King Lino. Standing behind them, though a long way off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
was Rabot; but his dirty clothes had given place to clean
ones, when his earnest desire was granted, and the princess
had made him head of her stables.</p>

<p>And here we must bid them all farewell, feeling sure they
will have many years of happiness before them after the
terrible trials through which they have passed.</p>

<h2><i>GEIRLAUG THE KING&rsquo;S DAUGHTER</i></h2>


<p>One day a powerful king and his beautiful wife were
sitting in the gardens of their capital city, talking
earnestly about the future life of their little son, who was
sleeping by their side in his beautiful golden cradle.
They had been married for many years without children,
so when this baby came they thought themselves the happiest
couple in the whole world. He was a fine sturdy
little boy, who loved to kick and to strike out with his fists;
but even if he had been weak and small they would still
have thought him the most wonderful creature upon earth,
and so absorbed were they in making plans for him,
that they never noticed a huge dark shadow creeping up,
till a horrible head with gleaming teeth stretched over
them, and in an instant their beloved baby was snatched
away.</p>

<p>For a while the king and queen remained where they
were, speechless with horror. Then the king rose slowly,
and holding out his hand to his wife, led her weeping
into the palace, and for many days their subjects saw no
more of them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dragon soared high into the air,
holding the cradle between his teeth, and the baby still
slept on. He flew so fast that he soon crossed the borders
of another kingdom, and again he beheld the king and
queen of the country seated in the garden with a little
girl lying in a wonderful cradle of white satin and lace.
Swooping down from behind as he had done before, he
was just about to seize the cradle, when the king jumped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
up and dealt him such a blow with his golden staff that the
dragon not only started back, but in his pain let fall the boy,
as he spread his wings and soared into the air away from
all danger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was a narrow escape,&rsquo; said the king, turning to
his wife, who sat pale with fright, and clasping her baby
tightly in her arms. &lsquo;Frightful,&rsquo; murmured the queen;
&lsquo;but look, what is that glittering object that is lying out
there?&rsquo; The king walked in the direction of her finger,
and to his astonishment beheld another cradle and another
baby.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! the monster must have stolen this as he sought to
steal Geirlaug,&rsquo; cried he. And stooping lower, he read
some words that were written on the fine linen that was
wound round the boy. &lsquo;This is Grethari, son of Grethari
the king!&rsquo; Unfortunately it happened that the two neighbouring
monarchs had had a serious quarrel, and for some
years had ceased holding communication with each other.
So, instead of sending a messenger at once to Grethari to
tell him of the safety of his son, the king contented himself
with adopting the baby, which was brought up with Geirlaug
the princess.</p>

<p>For a while things went well with the children, who
were as happy as the day was long, but at last there came
a time when the queen could no more run races or play at
hide-and-seek with them in the garden as she was so fond
of doing, but lay and watched them from a pile of soft
cushions. By-and-by she gave up doing even that, and
people in the palace spoke with low voices, and even Geirlaug
and Grethari trod gently and moved quietly when they
drew near her room. At length, one morning, they were
sent for by the king himself, who, his eyes red with weeping,
told them that the queen was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>Great was the sorrow of the two children, for they had
loved the queen very dearly, and life seemed dull without
her. But the lady-in-waiting who took care of them in
the tower which had been built for them while they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
still babies, was kind and good, and when the king was
busy or away in other parts of his kingdom she made them
quite happy, and saw that they were taught everything
that a prince and princess ought to know. Thus two or
three years passed, when, one day, as the children were
anxiously awaiting their father&rsquo;s return from a distant city,
there rode post haste into the courtyard of the palace a
herald whom the king had sent before him, to say that he
was bringing back a new wife.</p>

<p>Now, in itself, there was nothing very strange or
dreadful in the fact that the king should marry again,
but, as the old lady-in-waiting soon guessed, the queen, in
spite of her beauty, was a witch, and as it was easy to see
that she was jealous of everyone who might gain power
over her husband, it boded ill for Geirlaug and Grethari.
The faithful woman could not sleep for thinking about
her charges, and her soul sank when, a few months after
the marriage, war broke out with a country across the
seas, and the king rode away at the head of his troops.
Then there happened what she had so long expected.
One night, when, unlike her usual habit, she was sleeping
soundly&mdash;afterwards she felt sure that a drug had been
put into her food&mdash;the witch came to the tower. Exactly
what she did there no one knew, but, when the sun rose,
the beds of Grethari and Geirlaug were empty. At dawn
the queen summoned some of her guards, and told them
that she had been warned in a dream that some evil fate
would befall her through a wild beast, and bade them go
out and kill every animal within two miles of the palace.
But the only beasts they found were two black foals of
wondrous beauty, fitted for the king&rsquo;s riding; it seemed
a pity to kill them, for what harm could two little foals do
anyone? So they let them run away, frisking over the
plain, and returned to the palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you see <em>nothing</em>, really <em>nothing</em>?&rsquo; asked the queen,
when they again appeared before her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing, your majesty,&rsquo; they replied. But the queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
did not believe them, and when they were gone, she gave
orders to her steward that at supper the guards should be
well plied with strong drink so that their tongues should
be loosened, and, further, that he was to give heed to their
babble, and report to her, whatever they might let fall.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your majesty&rsquo;s commands have been obeyed,&rsquo; said the
steward when, late in the evening, he begged admittance
to the royal apartments; &lsquo;but, after all, the men have told
you the truth. I listened to their talk from beginning
to end, and nothing did they see save two black foals.&rsquo; He
might have added more, but the look in the queen&rsquo;s blazing
eyes terrified him, and, bowing hastily, he backed
quickly out of her presence.</p>

<p>In a week&rsquo;s time the king came home, and right glad
were all the courtiers to see him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, perhaps, she will find some one else to scream
at,&rsquo; whispered they amongst themselves. &lsquo;She&rsquo; was the
queen, who had vented her rage on her attendants
during these days, though what had happened to make
her so angry nobody knew. But whatever might be the
meaning of it, things would be sure to improve with the
king to rule in the palace instead of his wife. Unfortunately,
their joy only lasted a short while; for the very
first night after the king&rsquo;s arrival the queen related the
evil dream she had dreamt in his absence, and begged
him to go out the next morning and kill every living creature
he saw within two miles of the city. The king, who always
believed everything the queen said, promised to do as she
wished. But before he had ridden through the lovely
gardens that surrounded the palace, he was attracted
by the singing of two little blue birds perched on a
scarlet-berried holly, which made him think of everything
beautiful that he had ever heard of or imagined.
Hour after hour passed by, and still the birds sang,
and still the king listened, though of course he never
guessed that it was Geirlaug and Grethari whose
notes filled him with enchantment. At length darkness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
fell; the birds&rsquo; voices were hushed, and the king awoke with
a start to find that for that day his promise to the queen
could not be kept.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well! did you see anything?&rsquo; she asked eagerly, when
the king entered her apartments.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, my dear, I am almost ashamed to confess to
you. But the fact is that before I rode as far as the western
gate the singing of two strange little blue birds made me
forget all else in the world. And you will hardly believe
it&mdash;but not until it grew dark did I remember where
I was and what I should have been doing. However,
to-morrow nothing shall hinder me from fulfilling
your desires.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There will be no to-morrow,&rsquo; muttered the queen, as
she turned away with a curious glitter in her eyes. But
the king did not hear her.</p>

<p>That night the king gave a great supper in the
palace in honour of the victory he had gained over the
enemy. The three men whom the queen had sent forth
to slay the wild beasts held positions of trust in the household,
for to them was committed the custody of the
queen&rsquo;s person. And on the occasion of a feast their
places were always next that of the king, so it was
easy for the queen to scatter a slow but fatal poison
in their cups without anyone being the wiser. Before
dawn the palace was roused by the news that the king
was dead, and that the three officers of the guards were
dying also. Of course nobody&rsquo;s cries and laments were
as loud as those of the queen. But when once the
splendid funeral was over, she gave out that she was going
to shut herself up in a distant castle till the year of
her mourning was over, and after appointing a regent
of the kingdom, she set out attended only by a maid who
knew all her secrets. Once she had left the palace
she quickly began to work her spells, to discover under
what form Geirlaug and Grethari lay hidden. Happily,
the princess had studied magic under a former governess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
so was able to fathom her step-mother&rsquo;s wicked plot, and
hastily changed herself into a whale, and her foster-brother
into its fin. Then the queen took the shape of a shark and
gave chase.</p>

<p>For several hours a fierce battle raged between the
whale and the shark, and the sea around was red with
blood; first one of the combatants got the better, and then
the other, but at length it became plain to the crowd of
little fishes gathered round to watch, that the victory
would be to the whale. And so it was. But when, after
a mighty struggle, the shark floated dead and harmless
on the surface of the water, the whale was so exhausted
that she had only strength enough to drag her wounded
body into a quiet little bay, and for three days she
remained there as still and motionless as if she had been
dead herself. At the end of the three days her wounds
were healed, and she began to think what it was best to
do.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let us go back to your father&rsquo;s kingdom,&rsquo; she said to
Grethari, when they had both resumed their proper shapes,
and were sitting on a high cliff above the sea.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How clever you are! I never should have thought
of that!&rsquo; answered Grethari, who, in truth, was not clever
at all. But Geirlaug took a small box of white powder
from her dress, and sprinkled some over him and
some over herself, and, quicker than lightning, they
found themselves in the palace grounds from which
Grethari had been carried off by the dragon so many years
before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now take up the band with the golden letters and
bind it about your forehead,&rsquo; said Geirlaug, &lsquo;and go
boldly up to the castle. And, remember, however great
may be your thirst, you must drink nothing till you have
first spoken to your father. If you do, ill will befall us
both.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Why</em> should I be thirsty?&rsquo; replied Grethari, staring
at her in astonishment. &lsquo;It will not take me five minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
to reach the castle gate.&rsquo; Geirlaug held her peace, but her
eyes had in them a sad look. &lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; she said at last,
and she turned and kissed him.</p>

<p>Grethari had spoken truly when he declared that he
could easily get to the castle in five minutes. At least,
no one would have dreamed that it could possibly take
any longer. Yet, to his surprise, the door which stood
so widely open that he could see the colour of the hangings
within never appeared to grow any nearer, while each
moment the sun burned more hotly, and his tongue was
parched with thirst.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand! What <em>can</em> be the matter with
me&mdash;and why haven&rsquo;t I reached the castle long ago?&rsquo; he
murmured to himself, as his knees began to knock under
him with fatigue, and his head to swim. For a few more
paces he staggered on blindly, when, suddenly, the sound
of rushing water smote upon his ears; and in a little wood
that bordered the path he beheld a stream falling over
a rock. At this sight his promise to Geirlaug was forgotten.
Fighting his way through the brambles that tore his
clothes, he cast himself down beside the fountain, and seizing
the golden cup that hung from a tree, he drank a deep
draught.</p>

<p>When he rose up the remembrance of Geirlaug and of
his past life had vanished, and, instead, something stirred
dimly within him at the vision of the white-haired man
and woman who stood in the open door with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Grethari! Grethari! So you have come home at last,&rsquo;
cried they.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>For three hours Geirlaug waited in the spot where
Grethari had left her, and then she began to understand
what had happened. Her heart was heavy, but
she soon made up her mind what to do, and pushing
her way out of the wood, she skirted the high wall that
enclosed the royal park and gardens, till she reached a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
small house where the forester lived with his two
daughters.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you want a girl to sweep, and to milk the
cows?&rsquo; asked she, when one of the sisters answered her
knock.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, we do, very badly; and as you look strong and clean,
we will take you for a servant if you like to come,&rsquo; replied
the young woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, first, what is your name?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lauphertha,&rsquo; said Geirlaug quickly, for she did not
wish anyone to know who she was; and following her
new mistress into the house, she begged to be taught her
work without delay. And so clever was she, that, by-and-by,
it began to be noised abroad that the strange girl
who had come to live in the forester&rsquo;s house had not her
equal in the whole kingdom for skill as well as beauty.
Thus the years slipped away, during which Geirlaug grew
to be a woman. Now and then she caught glimpses of
Grethari as he rode out to hunt in the forest, but when
she saw him coming she hid herself behind the great trees,
for her heart was still sore at his forgetfulness. One day,
however, when she was gathering herbs, he came upon
her suddenly, before she had time to escape, though as
she had stained her face and hands brown, and covered
her beautiful hair with a scarlet cap, he did not guess her
to be his foster-sister.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is your name, pretty maiden?&rsquo; asked he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lauphertha,&rsquo; answered the girl with a low curtesy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! it is you, then, of whom I have heard so much,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;you are too beautiful to spend your life serving
the forester&rsquo;s daughters. Come with me to the palace,
and my mother the queen will make you one of her ladies
in waiting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Truly, that would be a great fortune,&rsquo; replied the maiden.
&lsquo;And, if you really mean it, I will go with you. But how
shall I know that you are not jesting?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give me something to do for you, and I will do it, whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
it is,&rsquo; cried the young man eagerly. And she cast
down her eyes, and answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go to the stable, and bind the calf that is there so that
it shall not break loose in the night and wander away,
for the forester and his daughters have treated me well,
and I would not leave them with aught of my work still
undone.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="not_get_free" id="not_get_free"></a>
<img src="images/ofb10.jpg" width="450" height="500"
alt="Grethari tries in vain to free himself"
title="Pull as he might he could not get free" />
</div>

<p>So Grethari set out for the stable where the calf
stood, and wound the rope about its horns. But when
he had made it fast to the wall, he found that a coil of the
rope had twisted itself round his wrist, and, pull as he
might, he could not get free. All night he wriggled and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
struggled till he was half dead with fatigue. But when
the sun rose the rope suddenly fell away from him, and,
very angry with the maiden he dragged himself back to
the palace. &lsquo;She is a witch,&rsquo; he muttered crossly to himself,
&lsquo;and I will have no more to do with her.&rsquo; And he
flung himself on his bed and slept all day.</p>

<p>Not long after this adventure the king and queen
sent their beloved son on an embassy to a neighbouring
country to seek a bride from amongst the seven princesses.
The most beautiful of all was, of course, the one chosen,
and the young pair took ship without delay for the
kingdom of the prince&rsquo;s parents. The wind was fair and
the vessel so swift that, in less time than could have been
expected, the harbour nearest the castle was reached.
A splendid carriage had been left in readiness close to
the beach, but no horses were to be found, for every one
had been carried off to take part in a great review which
the king was to hold that day in honour of his son&rsquo;s marriage.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here all day,&rsquo; said the princess, crossly,
when Grethari told her of the plight they were in. &lsquo;I am
perfectly worn out as it is, and you will have to find something
to draw the carriage, if it is only a donkey. If you
don&rsquo;t, I will sail back straight to my father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Poor Grethari was much troubled by the words of the
princess. Not that he felt so very much in love with
her, for during the voyage she had shown him several
times how vain and bad tempered she was; but as a
prince and a bridegroom, he could not, of course, bear to
think that any slight had been put upon her. So he
hastily bade his attendants to go in search of some animal,
and bring it at once to the place at which they were waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/ofb11.jpg" width="600" height="390"
alt="Grethari speaks to the maiden"
title="&#39;Will you lend me your ox, fair maiden?&#39;" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>During the long pause the princess sat in the beautiful
golden coach, her blue velvet mantle powdered with silver
bees drawn closely round her, so that not even the tip of
her nose could be seen. At length a girl appeared driving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
a young ox in front of her, followed by one of the prince&rsquo;s
messengers, who was talking eagerly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you lend me your ox, fair maiden?&rsquo; asked Grethari,
jumping up and going to meet them. &lsquo;You shall fix your
own price, and it shall be paid ungrudgingly, for never
before was king&rsquo;s son in such a plight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My price is seats for me and my two friends behind you
and your bride at the wedding feast,&rsquo; answered she. And
to this Grethari joyfully consented.</p>

<p>Six horses would not have drawn the coach at the speed
of this one ox. Trees and fields flew by so fast that the
bride became quite giddy, and expected, besides, that they
would be upset every moment. But, in spite of her fears,
nothing happened, and they drew up in safety at the door
of the palace, to the great surprise of the king and queen.
The marriage preparations were hurried on, and by the
end of the week everything was ready. It was, perhaps,
fortunate that the princess was too busy with her clothes
and her jewels during this period to pay much heed to
Grethari, so that by the time the wedding day came round
he had almost forgotten how cross and rude she had been
on the journey.</p>

<p>The oldest men and women in the town agreed that
nothing so splendid had ever been seen as the bridal
procession to the great hall, where the banquet was to be
held, before the ceremony was celebrated in the palace.
The princess was in high good humour, feeling that all
eyes were upon her, and bowed and smiled right and left.
Taking the prince&rsquo;s hand, she sailed proudly down the
room, where the guests were already assembled, to her
place at the head of the table by the side of the bridegroom.
As she did so, three strange ladies in shining
dresses of blue, green, and red, glided in and seated
themselves on a vacant bench immediately behind the young
couple. The red lady was Geirlaug, who had brought
with her the forester&rsquo;s daughters, and in one hand she held
a wand of birch bark, and in the other a closed basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
Silently they sat as the feast proceeded; hardly anyone
noticed their presence, or, if they did, supposed
them to be attendants of their future queen. Suddenly,
when the merriment was at its height, Geirlaug opened
the basket, and out flew a cock and hen. To the
astonishment of everyone, the birds circled about in front
of the royal pair, the cock plucking the feathers out of
the tail of the hen, who tried in vain to escape from him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you treat me as badly as Grethari treated Geirlaug?&rsquo;
cried the hen at last. And Grethari heard, and
started up wildly. In an instant all the past rushed back
to him; the princess by his side was forgotten, and he only
saw the face of the child with whom he had played long
years ago.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where is Geirlaug?&rsquo; he exclaimed, looking round the
hall; and his eyes fell upon the strange lady. With a smile
she held out a ring which he had given her on her twelfth
birthday, when they were still children, without a thought
of the future. &lsquo;You and none other shall be my wife,&rsquo; he
said, taking her hand, and leading her into the middle of
the company.</p>

<p>It is not easy to describe the scene that followed. Of
course, nobody understood what had occurred, and the
king and queen imagined that their son had suddenly gone
mad. As for the princess her rage and fury were beyond
belief. The guests left the hall as quickly as they could,
so that the royal family might arrange their own affairs,
and in the end it was settled that half the kingdom must
be given to the despised princess, instead of a husband.
She sailed back at once to her country, where she was soon
betrothed to a young noble, whom, in reality, she liked
much better than Grethari. That evening Grethari was
married to Geirlaug, and they lived happily till they died,
and made all their people happy also.</p>

<h2><i>THE STORY OF LITTLE KING LOC</i></h2>


<p>Two or three miles from the coast of France, anyone
sailing in a ship on a calm day can see deep, deep down,
the trunks of great trees standing up in the water.
Many hundreds of years ago these trees formed part of
a large forest, full of all sorts of wild animals, and
beyond the forest was a fine city, guarded by a castle in
which dwelt the Dukes of Clarides. But little by little
the sea drew nearer to the town; the foundations of the
houses became undermined and fell in, and at length a
shining sea flowed over the land. However, all this
happened a long time after the story I am going to tell
you.</p>

<p>The Dukes of Clarides had always lived in the midst of
their people, and protected them both in war and peace.</p>

<p>At the period when this tale begins the Duke Robert
was dead, leaving a young and beautiful duchess who
ruled in his stead. Of course everyone expected her to
marry again, but she refused all suitors who sought her
hand, saying that, having only one soul she could have
only one husband, and that her baby daughter was quite
enough for her.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>One day, she was sitting in the tower, which looked
out over a rocky heath, covered in summer with purple
and yellow flowers, when she beheld a troop of horsemen
riding towards the castle. In the midst, seated on a
white horse with black and silver trappings, was a lady
whom the duchess at once knew to be her friend the Countess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
of Blanchelande, a young widow like herself, mother of
a little boy two years older than Abeille des Clarides.
The duchess hailed her arrival with delight, but her joy
was soon turned into weeping when the countess sank
down beside her on a pile of cushions, and told the reason
of her visit.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you know,&rsquo; she said, taking her friend&rsquo;s hand
and pressing it between her own, &lsquo;whenever a Countess of
Blanchelande is about to die she finds a white rose lying
on her pillow. Last night I went to bed feeling unusually
happy, but this morning when I woke the rose was
resting against my cheek. I have no one to help me in
the world but you, and I have come to ask if you
will take Youri my son, and let him be a brother to
Abeille?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tears choked the voice of the duchess, but she flung
herself on the countess&rsquo;s neck, and pressed her close.
Silently the two women took leave of each other, and
silently the doomed lady mounted her horse and rode
home again. Then, giving her sleeping boy into the
care of Franc&oelig;ur, her steward, she laid herself quietly on
her bed, where, the next morning, they found her dead and
peaceful.</p>

<p>So Youri and Abeille grew up side by side, and the
duchess faithfully kept her promise, and was a mother to
them both. As they got bigger she often took them
with her on her journeys through her duchy, and
taught them to know her people, and to pity and to aid
them.</p>

<p>It was on one of these journeys that, after passing
through meadows covered with flowers, Youri caught sight
of a great glittering expanse lying beneath some distant
mountains.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is that, godmother?&rsquo; he asked, waving his hand.
&lsquo;The shield of a giant, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; a silver plate as big as the moon!&rsquo; said Abeille, twisting
herself round on her pony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
&lsquo;It is neither a silver plate nor a giant&rsquo;s shield,&rsquo; replied
the duchess; &lsquo;but a beautiful lake. Still, in spite of its
beauty, it is dangerous to go near it, for in its depths dwell
some Undines, or water spirits, who lure all passers-by to
their deaths.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about the lake, but the children
did not forget it, and one morning, after they had returned
to the castle, Abeille came up to Youri.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The tower door is open,&rsquo; whispered she; &lsquo;let us go up.
Perhaps we shall find some fairies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But they did not find any fairies; only, when they reached
the roof, the lake looked bluer and more enchanting than
ever. Abeille gazed at it for a moment, and then she
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you see? I mean to go there!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Youri. &lsquo;You heard what your
mother said. And, besides, it is so far; how could we get
there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>You</em> ought to know that,&rsquo; answered Abeille scornfully.
&lsquo;What is the good of being a man, and learning all sorts
of things, if you have to ask me. However, there are plenty
of other men in the world, and I shall get one of them to
tell me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Youri coloured; Abeille had never spoken like this
before, and, instead of being two years younger than
himself, she suddenly seemed many years older. She
stood with her mocking eyes fixed on him, till he grew
angry at being outdone by a girl, and taking her hand he
said boldly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, we will <em>both</em> go to the lake.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The next afternoon, when the duchess was working
at her tapestry surrounded by her maidens, the children
went out, as usual, to play in the garden. The moment
they found themselves alone, Youri turned to Abeille, and
holding out his hand, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
&lsquo;Come where?&rsquo; asked Abeille, opening her eyes very
wide.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To the lake, of course,&rsquo; answered the boy.</p>

<p>Abeille was silent. It was one thing to pretend you
meant to be disobedient some day, a long time off, and
quite another to start for such a distant place without
anyone knowing that you had left the garden. &lsquo;And
in satin shoes, too! How stupid boys were to be
sure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stupid or not, I am going to the lake, and you are going
with me!&rsquo; said Youri, who had not forgotten or forgiven
the look she had cast on him the day before. &lsquo;Unless,&rsquo;
added he, &lsquo;you are afraid, and in that case I shall
go alone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was too much for Abeille. Bursting into tears, she
flung herself on Youri&rsquo;s neck, and declared that wherever
he went she would go too. So, peace having been made
between them, they set out.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>It was a hot day, and the townspeople were indoors
waiting till the sun was low in the sky before they
set out either to work or play, so the children passed
through the streets unperceived, and crossed the river
by the bridge into the flowery meadows along the
road by which they had ridden with the duchess. By-and-by
Abeille began to feel thirsty, but the sun had drunk
up all the water, and not a drop was left for her.
They walked on a little further, and by good luck found
a cherry-tree covered with ripe fruit, and after a rest and
a refreshing meal, they were sure that they were strong
enough to reach the lake in a few minutes. But soon
Abeille began to limp and to say that her foot hurt her,
and Youri had to untie the ribbons that fastened her shoe
and see what was the matter. A stone had got in, so
this was easily set right, and for a while they skipped along
the path singing and chattering, till Abeille stopped
again. This time her shoe had come off, and turning to
pick it up she caught sight of the towers of the castle, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
such a long way off that her heart sank, and she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is getting dark, and the wolves will eat us,&rsquo; sobbed
she. But Youri put his arms round her and comforted
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why we are close to the lake now. There is nothing
to be afraid of! We shall be home again to supper,&rsquo; cried
he. And Abeille dried her eyes, and trotted on beside
him.</p>

<p>Yes, the lake was there, blue and silvery with purple
and gold irises growing on its banks, and white water-lilies
floated on its bosom. Not a trace was there of a
man, or of one of the great beasts so much feared by Abeille,
but only the marks of tiny forked feet on the sand. The
little girl at once pulled off her torn shoes and stockings
and let the water flow over her, while Youri looked about
for some nuts or strawberries. But none were to be
found.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I noticed, a little way back, a clump of blackberry
bushes,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Wait here for me, and I will go and
gather some fruit, and after that we will start home again.&rsquo;
And Abeille, leaning her head drowsily against a cushion
of soft moss, murmured something in reply, and soon
fell asleep. In her dream a crow, bearing the smallest
man that ever was seen, appeared hovering for a moment
above her, and then vanished. At the same instant Youri
returned and placed by her side a large leaf-full of
strawberries.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a pity to wake her just yet,&rsquo; thought he, and wandered
off beyond a clump of silvery willows to a spot from
which he could get a view of the whole lake. In the moonlight,
the light mist that hung over the surface made it
look like fairyland. Then gradually the silver veil seemed
to break up, and the shapes of fair women with outstretched
hands and long green locks floated towards him. Seized
with a sudden fright, the boy turned to fly. But it was
too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
Unconscious of the terrible doom that had befallen her
foster-brother, Abeille slept on, and did not awake even
when a crowd of little men with white beards down to their
knees came and stood in a circle round her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What shall we do with her?&rsquo; asked Pic, who seemed
older than any of them, though they were all very
old.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Build a cage and put her into it,&rsquo; answered Rug.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No! No! What should such a beautiful princess do
in a cage?&rsquo; cried Dig. And Tad, who was the kindest of
them all, proposed to carry her home to her parents. But
the other gnomes were too pleased with their new toy to
listen to this for a moment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look, she is waking,&rsquo; whispered Pau. And as he spoke
Abeille slowly opened her eyes. At first she imagined she
was still dreaming; but as the little men did not move, it
suddenly dawned upon her that they were real, and starting
to her feet, she called loudly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Youri! Youri! Where are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice the gnomes only pressed more
closely round her, and, trembling with fear, she hid her
face in her hands. The gnomes were at first much
puzzled to know what to do; then Tad, climbing on a
branch of the willow tree that hung over her, stooped
down, and gently stroked her fingers. The child understood
that he meant to be kind, and letting her hands
fall, gazed at her captors. After an instant&rsquo;s pause she
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little men, it is a great pity that you are so ugly. But,
all the same, I will love you if you will only give me something
to eat, as I am dying of hunger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A rustle was heard among the group as she spoke.
Some were very angry at being called ugly, and said she
deserved no better fate than to be left where she was.
Others laughed, and declared that it did not matter what
a mere mortal thought about them; while Tad bade Bog,
their messenger, fetch her some milk and honey, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
finest white bread that was made in their ovens under the
earth. In less time than Abeille would have taken to tie
her shoe he was back again, mounted on his crow. And
by the time she had eaten the bread and honey and drunk
the milk, Abeille was not frightened any more, and felt
quite ready to talk.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little men,&rsquo; she said, looking up with a smile, &lsquo;your
supper was very good, and I thank you for it. My name
is Abeille, and my brother is called Youri. Help me to
find him, and tell me which is the path that leads to the
castle, for mother must think something dreadful has happened
to us!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But your feet are so sore that you cannot walk,&rsquo; answered
Dig. &lsquo;And we may not cross the bounds into your country.
The best we can do is to make a litter of twigs and cover it
with moss, and we will bear you into the mountains, and
present you to our king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, many a little girl would have been terrified at
the thought of being carried off alone, she did not know
where. But Abeille, when she had recovered from her
first fright, was pleased at the notion of her strange
adventure.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How much she would have to tell her mother and Youri
on her return. Probably <em>they</em> would never go inside a
mountain, if they lived to be a hundred.&rsquo; So she curled
herself comfortably on her nest of moss, and waited to see
what would happen.</p>

<p>Up, and up, and up they went; and by-and-by Abeille
fell asleep again, and did not wake till the sun was shining.
Up, and up, and up, for the little men could only walk very
slowly, though they could spring over rocks quicker than
any mortal. Suddenly the light that streamed through the
branches of the litter began to change. It seemed hardly
less bright, but it was certainly different; then the litter
was put down, and the gnomes crowded round and helped
Abeille to step out of it.</p>

<p>Before her stood a little man not half her size, but splendidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
dressed and full of dignity. On his head was a crown
of such huge diamonds that you wondered how his small
body could support it. A royal mantle fell from his shoulders,
and in his hand he held a lance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;King Loc,&rsquo; said one of the forest gnomes, &lsquo;we found this
beautiful child asleep by the lake, and have brought her to
you. She says that her name is Abeille, and her mother
is the Duchess des Clarides.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have done well,&rsquo; answered the king; &lsquo;she shall be
one of us.&rsquo; And standing on tiptoe, so that he could kiss
her hand, he told her that they would all take care of her
and make her happy, and that anything she wished for she
should have at once.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want a pair of shoes,&rsquo; replied Abeille.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shoes!&rsquo; commanded the king, striking the ground
with his lance; and immediately a lovely pair of silver shoes
embroidered with pearls were slipped on her feet by one of
the gnomes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are beautiful shoes,&rsquo; said Abeille rather doubtfully;
&lsquo;but do you think they will carry me all the way back
to my mother?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, they are not meant for rough roads,&rsquo; replied the
king, &lsquo;but for walking about the smooth paths of the mountain,
for we have many wonders to show you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little King Loc,&rsquo; answered Abeille, &lsquo;take away these
beautiful slippers and give me a pair of wooden shoes instead,
and let me go back to my mother.&rsquo; But King Loc
only shook his head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little King Loc,&rsquo; said Abeille again&mdash;and this time her
voice trembled&mdash;&lsquo;let me go back to my mother and Youri,
and I will love you with all my heart, nearly as well as I love
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who is Youri?&rsquo; asked King Loc.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;Youri&mdash;who has lived with us since I was a
baby,&rsquo; replied Abeille; surprised that he did not know what
everyone else was aware of, and never guessing that by
mentioning the boy she was sealing her own fate. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
King Loc had already thought what a good wife she would
make him in a few years&rsquo; time, and he did not want Youri to
come between them. So he was silent, and Abeille, seeing
he was not pleased, burst into tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little King Loc,&rsquo; she cried, taking hold of a corner of
his mantle, &lsquo;think how unhappy my mother will be. She
will fancy that wild beasts have eaten me, or that I have
got drowned in the lake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Be comforted,&rsquo; replied King Loc; &lsquo;I will send her a
dream, so that she shall know that you are safe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this Abeille&rsquo;s sad face brightened. &lsquo;Little King Loc,&rsquo;
she said, smiling, &lsquo;how clever you are! But you must send
her a dream every night, so that she shall see <em>me</em>&mdash;and <em>me</em>
a dream, so that I may see her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And this King Loc promised to do.</p>

<p>When Abeille grew accustomed to do without her mother
and Youri, she made herself happy enough in her new
home. Everyone was kind to her, and petted her, and
then there were such quantities of new things for her
to see. The gnomes were always busy, and knew how
to fashion beautiful toys as well or better than the people
who lived on the earth; and now and then, wandering
with Tad or Dig in the underground passages, Abeille would
catch a glimpse of blue sky through a rent in the rocks, and
this she loved best of all. In this manner six years passed
away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;His Highness King Loc wishes to see you in his presence
chamber,&rsquo; said Tad, one morning, to Abeille, who was
singing to herself on a golden lute; and Abeille, wondering
why the king had grown so formal all of a sudden, got
up obediently. Directly she appeared, King Loc opened
a door in the wall which led into his treasure chamber.
Abeille had never been there before, and was amazed at
the splendid things heaped up before her. Gold, jewels,
brocades, carpets, lay round the walls, and she walked
about examining one glittering object after another, while
King Loc mounted a throne of gold and ivory at one end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
of the hall, and watched her. &lsquo;Choose whatever you wish,&rsquo;
he said at last. A necklace of most lovely pearls was
hanging from the wall, and after hesitating for a moment
between that and a circlet of diamonds and sapphires,
Abeille stretched up her hand towards it. But before she
touched it her eyes lighted on a tiny piece of sky visible
through a crack of the rock, and her hand dropped by her
side. &lsquo;Little King Loc, let me go up to the earth once
again,&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p>Then King Loc made a sign to the treasurer, who
opened a coffer full of nothing but precious stones, larger
and more dazzling than were worn by any earthly
monarch. &lsquo;Choose what you will, Abeille,&rsquo; whispered King
Loc.</p>

<p>But Abeille only shook her head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A drop of dew in the garden at Clarides is brighter to
me than the best of those diamonds,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;and
the bluest of the stones are not as blue as the eyes of Youri.&rsquo;
And as she spoke a sharp pain ran through the heart of
King Loc. For an instant he said nothing, then he lifted
his head and looked at her. &lsquo;Only those who despise
riches should possess them. Take this crown, from henceforth
you are the Princess of the Gnomes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>During thirty days no work was done in those underground
regions, for a feast was held in honour of the new
princess. At the end of that period, the king appeared
before Abeille, clad in his most splendid garments, and
solemnly asked her to be his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little King Loc,&rsquo; answered the girl, &lsquo;I love you as you
are, for your goodness and kindness to me; but never, never
can I love you as anything else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king sighed. It was only what he had expected;
still, his disappointment was great, though he tried bravely
to hide it, and even to smile as he said: &lsquo;Then, Abeille, will
you promise me one thing? If there should come a day
when you find that there is somebody whom you <em>could</em> love,
will you tell me?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
And in her turn Abeille promised.</p>

<p>After this, in spite of the fact that everyone was just
as kind to her as before, Abeille was no longer the merry
child who passed all her days playing with the little
gnomes. People who dwell under the earth grow up
much faster than those who live on its surface, and, at
thirteen, the girl was already a woman. Besides, King
Loc&rsquo;s words had set her thinking; she spent many hours
by herself, and her face was no longer round and rosy,
but thin and pale. It was in vain that the gnomes did
their best to entice her into her old games, they had lost
their interest, and even her lute lay unnoticed on the
ground.</p>

<p>But one morning a change seemed to come over her.
Leaving the room hung with beautiful silks, where she
usually sat alone, she entered the king&rsquo;s presence, and
taking his hand she led him through long corridors till
they came to a place where a strip of blue sky was to be
seen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little King Loc,&rsquo; she said, turning her eyes upon
him, &lsquo;let me behold my mother again, or I shall surely
die.&rsquo; Her voice shook, and her whole body trembled.
Even an enemy might have pitied her; but the king, who
loved her, answered nothing. All day long Abeille stayed
there, watching the light fade, and the sky grow pale.
By-and-by the stars came out, but the girl never moved
from her place. Suddenly a hand touched her. She
looked round with a start, and there was King Loc, covered
from head to foot in a dark mantle, holding another over
his arm. &lsquo;Put on this and follow me,&rsquo; was all he said.
But Abeille somehow knew that she was going to see her
mother.</p>

<p>On, and on, and on they went, through passages where
Abeille had never been before, and at length she was out
in the world again. Oh! how beautiful it all was! How
fresh was the air, and how sweet was the smell of the
flowers! She felt as if she should die with joy, but at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
that moment King Loc lifted her off the ground, and,
tiny though he was, carried her quite easily across
the garden and through an open door into the silent
castle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Listen, Abeille,&rsquo; he whispered softly. &lsquo;You have
guessed where we are going, and you know that every
night I send your mother a vision of you, and she talks
to it in her dream, and smiles at it. To-night it will be
no vision she sees, but you yourself; only remember, that
if you touch her or speak to her my power is lost,
and never more will she behold either you or your
image.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the room which Abeille
knew so well, and her heart beat violently as the gnome
carried her over the threshold. By the light of a lamp
hanging over the bed Abeille could see her mother,
beautiful still, but with a face that had grown pale and
sad. As she gazed the sadness vanished, and a bright
smile came in its stead. Her mother&rsquo;s arms were stretched
out towards her, and the girl, her eyes filled with tears
of joy, was stooping to meet them, when King Loc hastily
snatched her up, and bore her back to the realm of the
gnomes.</p>

<p>If the king imagined that by granting Abeille&rsquo;s
request he would make her happy, he soon found out
his mistake, for all day long the girl sat weeping,
paving no heed to the efforts of her friends to comfort
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me what is making you so unhappy?&rsquo; said King
Loc, at last. And Abeille answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/ofb13.jpg" width="367" height="600"
alt="King Loc carries Abeille away from her mother" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Little King Loc, and all my friends here, you are so
good and kind that I know that you are miserable when
I am in trouble. I would be happy if I could, but it is
stronger than I. I am weeping because I shall never
see again Youri de Blanchelande, whom I love with all
my heart. It is a worse grief than parting with my
mother, for at least I know where she is and what she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
is doing; while, as for Youri, I cannot tell if he is dead or
alive.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The gnomes were all silent. Kind as they were, they
were not mortals, and had never felt either great joys or
deep sorrows. Only King Loc dimly guessed at something
of both, and he went away to consult an old, old
gnome, who lived in the lowest depth of the mountain,
and had spectacles of every sort, that enabled him to see
all that was happening, not only on the earth, but under
the sea.</p>

<p>Nur, for such was his name, tried many of these
spectacles before he could discover anything about Youri
de Blanchelande.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There he is!&rsquo; he cried at last. &lsquo;He is sitting in the
palace of the Undines, under the great lake; but he does
not like his prison, and longs to be back in the world, doing
great deeds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was true. In the seven years that had passed
since he had left the castle of Clarides to go with
Abeille to the blue lake, Youri in his turn had become a
man.</p>

<p>The older he grew the more weary he got of the petting
and spoiling he received at the hands of the green-haired
maidens, till, one day, he flung himself at the feet of the
Undine queen, and implored permission to return to his
old home.</p>

<p>The queen stooped down and stroked his hair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We cannot spare you,&rsquo; she murmured gently. &lsquo;Stay
here, and you shall be king, and marry me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it is Abeille I want to marry,&rsquo; said the youth boldly.
But he might as well have talked to the winds, for at
last the queen grew angry, and ordered him to be put
in a crystal cage which was built for him round a
pointed rock.</p>

<p>It was here that King Loc, aided by the spectacles of
Nur, found him after many weeks&rsquo; journey. As we know,
the gnomes walk slowly, and the way was long and difficult.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
Luckily, before he started, he had taken with him his magic
ring, and the moment it touched the wall the crystal cage
split from top to bottom.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Follow that path, and you will find yourself in the
world again,&rsquo; he said to Youri; and without waiting to
listen to the young man&rsquo;s thanks, set out on the road he
had come.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bog,&rsquo; he cried, to the little man on the crow, who had
ridden to meet him. &lsquo;Hasten to the palace and inform the
Princess Abeille that Youri de Blanchelande, for seven
years a captive in the kingdom of the Undines, has now
returned to the castle of Clarides.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The first person whom Youri met as he came out of
the mountain was the tailor who had made all his clothes
from the time that he came to live at the castle. Of this
old friend, who was nearly beside himself with joy at
the sight of the little master, lost for so many years,
the count begged for news of his foster-mother and
Abeille.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas! my lord, where can you have been that you do
not know that the Princess Abeille was carried off by the
gnomes on the very day that you disappeared yourself?
At least, so we guess. Ah! that day has left many a
mark on our duchess! Yet she is not without a gleam of
hope that her daughter is living yet, for every night the
poor mother is visited by a dream which tells her all that
the princess is doing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The good man went on to tell of all the changes that
seven years had brought about in the village, but Youri
heard nothing that he said, for his mind was busy with
thoughts of Abeille.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<a name="stay_here" id="stay_here"></a>
<img src="images/ofb14.jpg" width="432" height="700"
alt="The Undine queen asks Youri to stay"
title="Stay here and you shall be king" />
</div>

<p>At length he roused himself, and ashamed of his
delay, he hastened to the chamber of the duchess, who
held him in her arms as if she would never let him go.
By-and-by, however, when she became calmer, he began
to question her about Abeille, and how best to deliver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
her from the power of the gnomes. The duchess then
told him that she had sent out men in all directions to
look for the children directly they were found to be
missing, and that one of them had noticed a troop of little
men far away on the mountains, evidently carrying a
litter. He was hastening after them, when, at his feet,
he beheld a tiny satin slipper, which he stooped to pick
up. But as he did so a dozen of the gnomes had
swarmed upon him like flies, and beat him about the
head till he dropped the slipper, which they took away
with them, leaving the poor man dizzy with pain. When
he recovered his senses the group on the mountain had disappeared.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>That night, when everyone was asleep, Youri and his
old servant Franc&oelig;ur, stole softly down into the armoury,
and dressed themselves in light suits of chain armour, with
helmets and short swords, all complete. Then they mounted
two horses that Franc&oelig;ur had tied up in the forest, and
set forth for the kingdom of the gnomes. At the end of an
hour&rsquo;s hard riding, they came to the cavern which Franc&oelig;ur
had heard from childhood led into the centre of the
earth. Here they dismounted, and entered cautiously, expecting
to find darkness as thick as what they had left outside.
But they had only gone a few steps when they were
nearly blinded by a sudden blaze of light, which seemed
to proceed from a sort of portcullis door, which barred the
way in front of them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; asked a voice. And the count
answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Youri de Blanchelande, who has come to rescue Abeille
des Clarides.&rsquo; And at these words the gate slowly swung
open, and closed behind the two strangers.</p>

<p>Youri listened to the clang with a spasm of fear in
his heart; then the desperate position he was in gave him
courage. There was no retreat for him now, and in
front was drawn up a large force of gnomes, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
arrows were falling like hail about him. He raised his
shield to ward them off, and as he did so his eyes fell on
a little man standing on a rock above the rest, with a crown
on his head and a royal mantle on his shoulders. In
an instant Youri had flung away his shield and sprung
forward, regardless of the arrows that still fell about
him.</p>

title="&#39;Is this the man you wish to marry?&#39;" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, is it you, is it <em>really</em> you, my deliverer? And is
it your subjects who hold as a captive Abeille whom I
love?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am King Loc,&rsquo; was the answer. And the figure with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
the long beard bent his eyes kindly on the eager youth.
&lsquo;If Abeille has lived with us all these years, for many of
them she was quite happy. But the gnomes, of whom you
think so little, are a just people, and they will not keep her
against her will. Beg the princess to be good enough to
come hither,&rsquo; he added, turning to Rug.</p>

<p>Amidst a dead silence Abeille entered the vast space and
looked around her. At first she saw nothing but a vast
host of gnomes perched on the walls and crowding on the
floor of the big hall. Then her eyes met those of Youri,
and with a cry that came from her heart she darted towards
him, and threw herself on his breast.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Abeille,&rsquo; said the king, when he had watched her for a
moment, with a look of pain on his face, &lsquo;is this the man
that you wish to marry?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Little King Loc, this is he and nobody else! And
see how I can laugh now, and how happy I am!&rsquo; And with
that she began to cry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush, Abeille! there must be no tears to-day,&rsquo; said
Youri, gently stroking her hair. &lsquo;Come, dry your eyes,
and thank King Loc, who rescued me from the cage in the
realm of the Undines.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As Youri spoke Abeille lifted her head, and a great light
came into her face. At last she understood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You did that for me?&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;Ah, Little King
Loc&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>So, loaded with presents, and followed by regrets,
Abeille went home. In a few days the marriage took
place; but however happy she was, and however busy
she might be, never a month passed by without a visit
from Abeille to her friends in the kingdom of the
gnomes.</p>

<h2>&lsquo;<i>A LONG-BOW STORY</i>&rsquo;</h2>


<p>One day a bunniah,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or banker, was walking along a
country road when he overtook a farmer going in the
same direction. Now the bunniah was very grasping,
like most of his class, and was lamenting that he had had
no chance of making any money that day; but at
the sight of the man in front he brightened up wonderfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a piece of luck,&rsquo; he said to himself. &lsquo;Let me see
if this farmer is not good for something&rsquo;; and he hastened
his steps.</p>

<p>After they had bid one another good day very politely,
the bunniah said to the farmer:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was just thinking how dull I felt, when I beheld you,
but since we are going the same way, I shall find the road
quite short in such agreeable company.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; replied the farmer; &lsquo;but what shall
we talk about? A city man like you will not care to hear
about cattle and crops.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the bunniah, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we will do.
We will each tell the other the wildest tale we can imagine,
and he who first throws doubt on the other&rsquo;s story shall
pay him a hundred rupees.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this the farmer agreed, and begged the bunniah to
begin, as he was the bigger man of the two; and privately
he made up his mind that, however improbable it might
be, nothing should induce him to hint that he did not believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
in the bunniah&rsquo;s tale. Thus politely pressed the great man
started:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was going along this road one day, when I met a merchant
travelling with a great train of camels laden with
merchandise&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; murmured the farmer; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that kind
of thing myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No less than one hundred and one camels,&rsquo; continued
the bunniah, &lsquo;all tied together by their nose strings&mdash;nose
to tail&mdash;and stretching along the road for almost half a
mile&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said the farmer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, a kite swooped down on the foremost camel and
bore him off, struggling, into the air, and by reason of
them all being tied together the other hundred camels had
to follow&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amazing, the strength of that kite!&rsquo; said the farmer.
&lsquo;But&mdash;well&mdash;yes, doubtless; yes&mdash;well&mdash;one hundred
and one camels&mdash;and what did he do with them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You doubt it?&rsquo; demanded the bunniah.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a bit!&rsquo; said the farmer heartily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued the bunniah, &lsquo;it happened that the
princess of a neighbouring kingdom was sitting in her
private garden, having her hair combed by her maid, and
she was looking upward, with her head thrown back,
whilst the maid tugged away at the comb, when that
wretched kite, with its prey, went soaring overhead; and,
as luck would have it, the camels gave an extra kick
just then, the kite lost his hold, and the whole hundred
and one camels dropped right into the princess&rsquo;s left
eye!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor thing!&rsquo; said the farmer; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s so painful having anything
in one&rsquo;s eye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the bunniah, who was now warming to his
task, &lsquo;the princess shook her head, and sprang up, clapping
her hand on her eye. &ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
something in my eye, and how it <em>does</em> smart!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
&lsquo;It always does,&rsquo; observed the farmer, &lsquo;perfectly true.
Well, what did the poor thing do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At the sound of her cries, the maid came running to
her assistance. &ldquo;Let me look,&rdquo; said she; and with that
she gave the princess&rsquo;s eyelid a twitch, and out came a
camel, which the maid put in her pocket&mdash;&rsquo; (&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;
grunted the farmer)&mdash;&lsquo;and then she just twisted up the
corner of her headcloth and fished a hundred more of them
out of the princess&rsquo;s eye, and popped them all into her
pocket with the other.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here the bunniah gasped as one who is out of breath, but
the farmer looked at him slowly. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything more now,&rsquo; replied the
bunniah. &lsquo;Besides, that is the end; what do you say to
it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wonderful,&rsquo; replied the farmer, &lsquo;and no doubt perfectly
true!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it is your turn,&rsquo; said the bunniah. &lsquo;I am so
anxious to hear your story. I am sure it will be very interesting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I think it will,&rsquo; answered the farmer, and he began:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father was a very prosperous man. Five cows he
had, and three yoke of oxen, and half a dozen buffaloes,
and goats in abundance; but of all his possessions the thing
he loved best was a mare. A well bred mare she was&mdash;oh,
a very fine mare!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; interrupted the bunniah, &lsquo;get on!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m getting on,&rsquo; said the farmer, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you hurry me!
Well, one day, as ill-luck would have it, he rode that mare
to market with a torn saddle, which galled her so, that
when they got home she had a sore on her back as big as
the palm of your hand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the bunniah impatiently, &lsquo;what next?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;It was June,&rsquo; said the farmer, &lsquo;and you know how, in
June, the air is full of dust-storms with rain at times?
Well, the poor beast got dust in that wound, and what&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
more, with the dust some grains of wheat, and, what with
the dust and the heat and the wet, that wheat sprouted and
began to grow!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wheat does when it gets a fair chance,&rsquo; said the
bunniah.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; and the next thing we knew was that there was
a crop of wheat on that horse&rsquo;s back as big as anything you
ever saw in a hundred-acre field, and we had to hire twenty
men to reap it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One generally has to hire extra hands for reaping,&rsquo; said
the bunniah.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And we got four hundred maunds of wheat off that
mare&rsquo;s back!&rsquo; continued the farmer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A good crop!&rsquo; murmured the bunniah.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And your father,&rsquo; said the farmer, &lsquo;a poor wretch,
with hardly enough to keep body and soul together&mdash;(the
bunniah snorted, but was silent)&mdash;came to my father, and
he said, putting his hands together as humble as could
be&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bunniah here flashed a furious glance at his companion,
but bit his lips and held his peace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tasted food for a week. Oh! great master,
let me have the loan of sixteen maunds of wheat from your
store, and I will repay you.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly, neighbour,&rdquo; answered my father; &ldquo;take
what you need, and repay it as you can.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; demanded the bunniah with fury in his
eye.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, he took the wheat away with him,&rsquo; replied the
farmer; &lsquo;but he never repaid it, and it&rsquo;s a debt to this day.
Sometimes I wonder whether I shall not go to law about
it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the bunniah began running his thumb quickly up
and down the fingers of his right hand, and his lips moved
in quick calculation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked the farmer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The wheat is the cheaper; I&rsquo;ll pay you for the wheat,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
said the bunniah, with the calmness of despair, as he remembered
that by his own arrangement he was bound to give
the farmer a hundred rupees.</p>

<p>And to this day they say in those parts, when a man owes
a debt: &lsquo;Give me the money; or, if not that, give me at
least the wheat.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>JACKAL OR TIGER?</i></h2>


<p>One hot night, in Hindustan, a king and queen lay awake
in the palace in the midst of the city. Every now and then
a faint air blew through the lattice, and they hoped they
were going to sleep, but they never did. Presently they
became more broad awake than ever at the sound of a howl
outside the palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Listen to that tiger!&rsquo; remarked the king.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tiger?&rsquo; replied the queen. &lsquo;How should there be a
tiger inside the city? It was only a jackal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I tell you it was a tiger,&rsquo; said the king.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I tell you that you were dreaming if you thought
it was anything but a jackal,&rsquo; answered the queen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say it was a tiger,&rsquo; cried the king; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t contradict
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; snapped the queen. &lsquo;It was a jackal.&rsquo;
And the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at
last:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll call the guard and ask; and if it was
a jackal I&rsquo;ll leave this kingdom to you and go away; and
if it was a tiger then you shall go, and I will marry a new
wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you like,&rsquo; answered the queen, &lsquo;there isn&rsquo;t any doubt
which it was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the king called the two soldiers who were on guard
outside and put the question to them. But, whilst the
dispute was going on, the king and queen had got so excited
and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all
they said, and one man observed to the other:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
&lsquo;Mind you declare that the king is right. It certainly
was a jackal, but, if we say so, the king will probably not
keep his word about going away, and we shall get into
trouble, so we had better take his side.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this the other agreed; therefore, when the king asked
them what animal they had seen, both the guards said
it was certainly a tiger, and that the king was right of
course, as he always was. The king made no remark,
but sent for a palanquin, and ordered the queen to be
placed in it, bidding the four bearers of the palanquin
to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave
her. In spite of her tears, she was forced to obey, and
away the bearers went for three days and three nights
until they came to a dense wood. There they set down
the palanquin with the queen in it, and started home
again.</p>

<p>Now the queen thought to herself that the king could
not mean to send her away for good, and that as soon as
he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her
back; so she stayed quite still for a long time, listening
with all her ears for approaching footsteps, but heard
none. After a while she grew nervous, for she was all
alone, and put her head out of the palanquin and looked
about her. Day was just breaking, and birds and insects
were beginning to stir; the leaves rustled in a warm breeze;
but, although the queen&rsquo;s eyes wandered in all directions,
there was no sign of any human being. Then her spirit
gave way, and she began to cry.</p>

<p>It so happened that close to the spot where the queen&rsquo;s
palanquin had been set down, there dwelt a man who
had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest, where he and
his wife lived alone far from any neighbours. As it was
hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof
of his house, but was awakened by the sound of weeping.
He jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could, and
into the forest towards the place the sound came from, and
there he found the palanquin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
&lsquo;Oh, poor soul that weeps,&rsquo; cried the farmer, standing
a little way off, &lsquo;who are you?&rsquo; At this salutation from
a stranger the queen grew silent, dreading she knew not
what.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<a name="weeping_queen" id="weeping_queen"></a>
<img src="images/ofb17.jpg" width="366" height="500"
alt="The farmer finds the queen weeping by the palanquin" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you that weep,&rsquo; repeated the farmer, &lsquo;fear not to
speak to me, for you are to me as a daughter. Tell me,
who are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
His voice was so kind that the queen gathered up her
courage and spoke. And when she had told her story, the
farmer called his wife, who led her to their house, and gave
her food to eat, and a bed to lie on. And in the farm, a
few days later, a little prince was born, and by his mother&rsquo;s
wish named Ameer Ali.</p>

<p>Years passed without a sign from the king. His wife
might have been dead for all he seemed to care, though
the queen still lived with the farmer, and the little prince
had by this time grown up into a strong, handsome, and
healthy youth. Out in the forest they seemed far from
the world; very few ever came near them, and the prince
was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be
allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his
own living. But she and the wise farmer always counselled
him to wait, until, at last, when he was eighteen years of
age, they had not the heart to forbid him any longer. So
he started off one early morning, with a sword by his side,
a big brass pot to hold water, a few pieces of silver, and a
galail<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or two-stringed bow in his hand, with which to
shoot birds as he travelled.</p>

<p>Many a weary mile he tramped day after day, until,
one morning, he saw before him just such a forest as that
in which he had been born and bred, and he stepped joyfully
into it, like one who goes to meet an old friend. Presently,
as he made his way through a thicket, he saw a pigeon
which he thought would make a good dinner, so he fired
a pellet at it from his galail, but missed the pigeon which
fluttered away with a startled clatter. At the same instant
he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket, and,
on reaching the spot, he found an ugly old woman streaming
wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head an
earthen vessel with a hole in it from which the water was
pouring. When she saw the prince with his galail in his
hand, she called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
&lsquo;Oh, wretched one! why must you choose an old woman
like me to play your pranks upon? Where am I to get a
fresh pitcher instead of this one that you have broken with
your foolish tricks? And how am I to go so far for water
twice when one journey wearies me?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
<a name="unlucky_shot" id="unlucky_shot"></a>
<img src="images/ofb18.jpg" width="436" height="500"
alt="Water pours over the old woman from the hole in the pot"
title="The unlucky shot" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;But, mother,&rsquo; replied the prince, &lsquo;I played no trick
upon you! I did but shoot at a pigeon that should have
served me for dinner, and as my pellet missed it, it must
have broken your pitcher. But, in exchange, you shall
have my brass pot, and that will not break easily; and as
for getting water, tell me where to find it, and I&rsquo;ll fetch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
it while you dry your garments in the sun, and carry it
whither you will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this the old woman&rsquo;s face brightened. She showed
him where to seek the water, and when he returned a
few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim, she led
the way without a word, and he followed. In a short
while they came to a hut in the forest, and as they drew
near it Ameer Ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest
damsel his eyes had ever looked on. At the sight of a
stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the
hut, and much as he wished to see her again Ameer Ali
could think of no excuse by which to bring her back, and
so, with a heavy heart, he made his salutation, and bade
the old woman farewell. But when he had gone a little
way she called after him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If ever you are in trouble or danger, come to where you
now stand and cry: &ldquo;Fairy of the Forest! Fairy of the
forest, help me now!&rdquo; And I will listen to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince thanked her and continued his journey,
but he thought little of the old woman&rsquo;s saying, and much
of the lovely damsel. Shortly afterwards he arrived at a
city; and, as he was now in great straits, having come to
the end of his money, he walked straight to the palace of
the king and asked for employment. The king said he
had plenty of servants and wanted no more; but the young
man pleaded so hard that at last the rajah was sorry for
him, and promised that he should enter his bodyguard
on the condition that he would undertake any service which
was especially difficult or dangerous. This was just what
Ameer Ali wanted, and he agreed to do whatever the king
might wish.</p>

<p>Soon after this, on a dark and stormy night, when the
river roared beneath the palace walls, the sound of a woman
weeping and wailing was heard above the storm. The
king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter;
but the servant, falling on his knees in terror, begged that
he might not be sent on such an errand, particularly on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
night so wild, when evil spirits and witches were sure to be
abroad. Indeed, so frightened was he, that the king, who
was very kind-hearted, bade another to go in his stead,
but each one showed the same strange fear. Then Ameer
Ali stepped forward:</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is my duty, your majesty,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I will go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king nodded, and off he went. The night was as
dark as pitch, and the wind blew furiously and drove the
rain in sheets into his face; but he made his way down
to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the
flooded water. Inch by inch, and foot by foot he fought
his way across, now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden
swirl or eddy, now narrowly escaping being caught in the
branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging
down the stream. At length he emerged, panting and
dripping wet, on the other side. Close by the bank stood
a gallows, and on the gallows hung the body of some evildoer,
whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing
that the king had heard.</p>

<p>Ameer Ali was so grieved for the one who wept there
that he thought nothing of the wildness of the night or of
the roaring river. As for ghosts and witches, they had
never troubled him, so he walked up towards the gallows
where crouched the figure of the woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What ails you?&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>Now the woman was not really a woman at all, but a
horrid kind of witch who really lived in Witchland, and
had no business on earth. If ever a man strayed into
Witchland the ogresses used to eat him up, and this old
witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper,
and that is why she had been sobbing and crying in hopes
that someone out of pity might come to her rescue.</p>

<p>So when Ameer Ali questioned her, she replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, kind sir, it is my poor son who hangs upon that
gallows; help me to get him down and I will bless you for
ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ameer Ali thought that her voice sounded rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
eager than sorrowful, and he suspected that she was
not telling the truth, so he determined to be very
cautious.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<a name="anklet_won" id="anklet_won"></a>
<img src="images/ofb19.jpg" width="398" height="500"
alt="Ameer Ali wins the anklet" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;That will be rather difficult,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for the gallows
is high, and we have no ladder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, but if you will just stoop down and let me climb
upon your shoulders,&rsquo; answered the old witch, &lsquo;I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
I could reach him.&rsquo; And her voice now sounded so cruel
that Ameer Ali was sure that she intended some evil. But
he only said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, we will try.&rsquo; With that he drew his sword,
pretending that he needed it to lean upon, and bent so that
the old woman could clamber on to his back, which she
did very nimbly. Then, suddenly, he felt a noose slipped
over his neck, and the old witch sprang from his shoulders
on to the gallows, crying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, foolish one, I have got you, and will kill you for
my supper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Ameer Ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp
sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck,
and not only cut the cord but cut also the old woman&rsquo;s foot
as it dangled above him; and with a yell of pain and anger
she vanished into the darkness.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Ameer Ali then sat down to collect himself a little,
and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had
evidently fallen off the old witch&rsquo;s foot. This he put into
his pocket, and as the storm had by this time passed over
he made his way back to the palace. When he had finished
his story, he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed
it to the king, who, like everyone else, was amazed at
the glory of the jewels which composed it. Indeed,
Ameer Ali himself was astonished, for he had slipped
the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not
looked at it since. The king was delighted at its
beauty, and having praised and rewarded Ameer Ali,
he gave the anklet to his daughter, a proud and spoiled
princess.</p>

<p>Now in the women&rsquo;s apartments in the palace there
hung two cages, in one of which was a parrot and in the
other a starling, and these two birds could talk as
well as human beings. They were both pets of the
princess who always fed them herself, and the next day,
as she was walking grandly about with her treasure tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
round her ankle, she heard the starling say to the
parrot:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Tot&eacute;&rsquo; (that was the parrot&rsquo;s name), &lsquo;how do you
think the princess looks in her new jewel?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think?&rsquo; snapped the parrot, who was cross because
they hadn&rsquo;t given him his bath that morning, &lsquo;I think
she looks like a washerwoman&rsquo;s daughter, with one shoe
on and the other off! Why doesn&rsquo;t she wear two of them,
instead of going about with one leg adorned and the other
empty?&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the princess heard this she burst into tears; and
sending for her father she declared that he must get her
another such an anklet to wear on the other leg, or she
would die of shame. So the king sent for Ameer Ali and
told him that he must get a second anklet exactly like the
first within a month, or he should be hanged, for the princess
would certainly die of disappointment.</p>

<p>Poor Ameer Ali was greatly troubled at the king&rsquo;s command,
but he thought to himself that he had, at any rate,
a month in which to lay his plans. He left the palace
at once, and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels
were to be got; but though he sought night and day he
never found one to compare with the anklet. At last
only a week remained, and he was in sore difficulty, when
he remembered the Fairy of the forest, and determined
to go without loss of time and seek her. Therefore away
he went, and after a day&rsquo;s travelling he reached the cottage
in the forest, and, standing where he had stood when the
old woman called to him, he cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fairy of the forest! Fairy of the forest! Help me!
help me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he
had seen before, whom in all his wanderings he had never
forgotten.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; she asked, in a voice so soft that
he listened like one struck dumb, and she had to
repeat the question before he could answer. Then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
told her his story, and she went within the cottage and
came back with two wands, and a pot of boiling water.
The two wands she planted in the ground about six feet
apart, and then, turning to him, she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am going to lie down between these two wands.
You must then draw your sword and cut off my foot,
and, as soon as you have done that, you must seize it and
hold it over the cauldron, and every drop of blood that
falls from it into the water will become a jewel. Next
you must change the wands so that the one that stood at
my head is at my feet, and the one at my feet stands at
my head, and place the severed foot against the wound
and it will heal, and I shall become quite well again as
before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At first Ameer Ali declared that he would sooner be
hanged twenty times over than treat her so roughly; but
at length she persuaded him to do her bidding. He nearly
fainted himself with horror when he found that, after
the cruel blow which lopped her foot off, she lay as one
lifeless; but he held the severed foot over the cauldron,
and, as drops of blood fell from it, and he saw each turn
in the water into shining gems, his heart took courage.
Very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron,
and he quickly changed the wands, placed the severed
foot against the wound, and immediately the two parts
became one as before. Then the maiden opened her eyes,
sprang to her feet, and drawing her veil about her, ran
into the hut, and would not come out or speak to him
any more. For a long while he waited, but, as she did
not appear, he gathered up the precious stones and returned
to the palace. He easily got some one to set the
jewels, and found that there were enough to make, not
only one, but three rare and beautiful anklets, and
these he duly presented to the king on the very day that
his month of grace was over.</p>

<p>The king embraced him warmly, and made him rich
gifts; and the next day the vain princess put two anklets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
on each foot, and strutted up and down in them admiring
herself in the mirrors that lined her room.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Tot&eacute;,&rsquo; asked the starling, &lsquo;how do you think our
princess looks now in these fine jewels?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ofb20.jpg" width="500" height="397"
alt="Ameer Ali follows the maiden&#39;s instructions to win more jewels" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; growled the parrot, who was really always cross
in the mornings, and never recovered his temper until
after lunch, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s got all her beauty at one end of her
now; if she had a few of those fine gew-gaws round her
neck and wrists she would look better; but now, to my
mind, she looks more than ever like the washerwoman&rsquo;s
daughter dressed up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Poor princess! she wept and stormed and raved until
she made herself quite ill; and then she declared to her
father that, unless she had bracelets and necklace to match
the anklets she would die.</p>

<p>Again the king sent for Ameer Ali, and ordered him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within
a month, or be put to a cruel death.</p>

<p>And again Ameer Ali spent nearly the whole month
searching for the jewels, but all in vain. At length he
made his way to the hut in the forest, and stood and
cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fairy of the forest! Fairy of the forest! Help me!
help me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons
and asked what he wanted, and when he had told
her she said he must do exactly as he had done the first
time, except that now he must cut off both her hands and
her head. Her words turned Ameer Ali pale with horror;
but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before,
and at last he consented to do as she bade him. From
her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron
bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds, emeralds
and pearls that surpassed any that ever were seen. Then
the head and hands were joined on to the body, and left
neither sign nor scar. Full of gratitude, Ameer Ali tried
to speak to her, but she ran into the house and would not
come back, and he was forced to leave her and go away
laden with the jewels.</p>

<p>When, on the day appointed, Ameer Ali produced a
necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless
than the last, the king&rsquo;s astonishment knew no bounds,
and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy.
The very next morning she put on all her finery, and thought
that now, at least, that disagreeable parrot could find no
fault with her appearance, and she listened eagerly when
she heard the starling say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Tot&eacute;, how do you think our princess is looking
<em>now</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very fine, no doubt,&rsquo; grumbled the parrot; &lsquo;but what
is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only? She
ought to have a husband&mdash;why doesn&rsquo;t she marry the
man who got her all these splendid things?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
Then the princess sent for her father and told him that
she wished to marry Ameer Ali.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear child,&rsquo; said her father, &lsquo;you really are very
difficult to please, and want something new every day.
It certainly is time you married someone, and if you choose
this man, of course he shall marry you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the king sent for Ameer Ali, and told him that
within a month he proposed to do him the honour of
marrying him to the princess, and making him heir to
the throne.</p>

<p>On hearing this speech Ameer Ali bowed low and
answered that he had done and would do the king all
the service that lay in his power, save only this one thing.
The king, who considered his daughter&rsquo;s hand a prize
for any man, flew into a passion, and the princess was
more furious still. Ameer Ali was instantly thrown into
the most dismal prison that they could find, and ordered
to be kept there until the king had time to think in what
way he should be put to death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought
in any case to be married without delay, so he sent forth
heralds throughout the neighbouring countries, proclaiming
that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom
and heir to the throne should present himself at the
palace.</p>

<p>When the day came, all the court were gathered together,
and a great crowd assembled of men, young and
old, who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone
else to gain both the throne and the princess. As
soon as the king was seated, he called upon an usher to
summon the first claimant. But, just then, a farmer who
stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition
to offer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, hasten then,&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;I have no time to
waste.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your majesty,&rsquo; said the farmer, &lsquo;has now lived and
administered justice long in this city, and will know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
the tiger who is king of beasts hunts only in the forest,
whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something
to be picked up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is all this? what is all this?&rsquo; asked the king.
&lsquo;The man must be mad!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, your majesty,&rsquo; answered the farmer, &lsquo;I would
only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals
gathered to-day to try and claim your daughter and
kingdom: every city has sent them, and they wait hungry
and eager; but do not, O king, mistake or pretend again
to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of
a tiger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king turned first red and then pale.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is,&rsquo; continued the farmer, &lsquo;a royal tiger bred
in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your
throne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where? what do you mean?&rsquo; stammered the king,
growing pale as he listened.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In prison,&rsquo; replied the farmer; &lsquo;if your majesty will
clear this court of the jackals I will explain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Clear the court!&rsquo; commanded the king; and, very
unwillingly, the visitors left the palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now tell me what riddle this is,&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>Then the farmer told the king and his ministers how
he had rescued the queen and brought up Ameer Ali;
and he fetched the old queen herself, whom he had left
outside. At the sight of her the king was filled with shame
and self-reproach, and wished he could have lived his
life over again, and not have married the mother of the
proud princess, who caused him endless trouble until her
death.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My day is past,&rsquo; said he. And he gave up his crown
to his son Ameer Ali, who went once more and called to
the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his
throne.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is only one person I will marry,&rsquo; said he. And
this time the maiden did not run away, but agreed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
his wife. So the two were married without delay, and
lived long and reigned happily.</p>

<p>As for the old woman whose pitcher Ameer Ali had
broken, she was the forest maiden&rsquo;s fairy godmother, and
when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she
gladly returned to fairyland.</p>

<p>The old king has never been heard to contradict his
wife any more. If he even looks as if he does not agree
with her, she smiles at him and says:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it the tiger, then? or the jackal?&rsquo; And he has not
another word to say.</p>

<h2><i>THE COMB AND THE COLLAR</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a king of Lombardy who,
though he was uglier than any of his subjects, loved beauty
in others, so he married a wife who was declared by everyone
to be the handsomest of women; and, whispered some,
the most ill-natured also. Certainly she could not endure
the sight of a pretty person, and her ladies were all the
plainest of their sex. Worse than all, she was desperately
jealous of the king&rsquo;s son and daughter by his
former wife.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in spite of all her evil qualities, the king
was her complete slave, and badly though she treated
the boy, the lovely princess was made to suffer ten times
as much. Not contented with giving the girl, for a governess,
a woman whose temper was as bad as the queen&rsquo;s
own, the cruel step-mother did everything she could
think of to spoil the girl&rsquo;s beauty, and to force her to
appear as ugly as she was herself; but, try as she might,
when the hideous clothes and frightful brown paint
had been removed, her loveliness shone out as bright
as ever.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Now the king of Lombardy was cousin to the Archduke
of Placenza, who had lately lost his reason, to the
great grief of his son and daughter, Perarthrites and Ferrandina.
The doctors having all failed to restore him
to health, the prince and princess sent a messenger to
consult a famous enchantress, called the Mother of Sheaths,
because everyone who visited her brought with him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
knife, which she thrust into one of the sheaths with which
her cavern was lined. However, they obtained little
comfort from the witch, who bade them &lsquo;seek their father&rsquo;s
wits in the place where he had lost them.&rsquo; Against the
wishes of the chief ministers, Perarthrites and Ferrandina
rode off to the mysterious castle where the king
had slept when his terrible fate had overtaken him,
and, once inside the gates, nothing more was heard of
them.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>When three weeks had passed and still there was no
news, the king&rsquo;s chief minister called a council to talk
over the matter, and, at the end, it was decided that a
company of distinguished persons should visit the Mother
of Sheaths, and that the knives they must take with them
should be of pure gold, richly set with precious stones.
The witch was so pleased with the beauty of the gifts
that she not only listened attentively to their story, but
proceeded to a hole in the cavern, from which she drew
out a little case containing a comb, and a steel collar,
fastened by a gold key.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Carry this comb and the collar to every court until
you find a lady beautiful enough to unlock the collar,
and a man good enough to draw the comb from its case.
When you have discovered these, you can return whence
you came.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I do not see,&rsquo; said the chamberlain, &lsquo;how
that will help us to bring back our lost prince and
princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is all I can do for you,&rsquo; answered the Mother of
Sheaths; and she went into the back of the cavern, where
they dared not follow her.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>For the next few months the mad king&rsquo;s principal ministers
wandered from one court to another, till at last they
reached Lombardy, where they found that their story had
already travelled before them. As soon as they appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
in the presence-chamber the king received them with open
arms, for in his heart he had no doubt that his wife was
the peerless beauty destined to unfasten the collar. And,
indeed, if paint and hair-dye and magnificent dresses
could have ensured her doing so, he would certainly have
been right. But, blinded by his love for this wicked
woman, he had really no idea that her charms were not
her own.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the queen entered the throne-room,
having by her side the young princess, in the most
grievous plight imaginable. Her dress was so contrived
as to give the idea that she had a hump; her pink-and-white
skin was thickly covered with yellow paint, and
her black hair all hidden by a close-fitting brown cloth
cap. Murmurs of indignation rose on all sides, and the
ambassadors, who had frequently heard the princess
compared to the lovely Ferrandina, were dumb with
astonishment. As for the king, he could hardly raise
his eyes from the ground, so ashamed was he; and
signing to his son to take his place, he withdrew from
the scene.</p>

<p>Mounting the throne, the prince commanded the trial
to begin at once, and the collar was handed to the princess&rsquo;s
governess, who, being one of the ugliest women that
ever was seen, naturally failed to turn the key. Seizing
the chance of his being for a short time in power, the prince
resolved to punish her cruelties towards his sister, and
especially this last one, to which she had prompted the
queen, and ordered her to be taken out and executed,
which was done, with great good will, by the attendants.
He then further commanded the ladies in waiting to attend
his sister to her apartments, and bathe her and dress her
in the queen&rsquo;s most splendid robes, as she had none of
her own; and the queen, though gnashing her teeth with
anger, for once dared not interfere. More quickly than
could have been expected, the princess returned, looking
so beautiful that if anyone had doubted before who would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
be able to unlock the collar they were instantly convinced.
The prince glanced at her, but said nothing, and, signing
to one of the ambassadors, he ordered him to make trial
of the comb. One by one each man present did his best
to remove it from its case, and one by one each was forced
to own himself beaten. At length only the prince
remained, but as he was the judge he must wait till
the last.</p>

<p>After the men had finished, the ladies of the court
had the collar presented to them according to rank, but
none could even turn the key. Finally it was handed to
the queen, who managed to open it a little way. Her
heart beat with triumph, but immediately it closed again
with a snap, and she sank back, fainting from disappointment.</p>

<p>By this time there were only left the prince and his
sister; and no sooner did he touch the case than it opened
of itself, while the lock of the collar yielded directly the
princess took hold of the key. Cries of delight rose from
the courtiers and attendants; but these were interrupted
by a whirlwind accompanied by thick darkness, and followed
by an earthquake.</p>

<p>When all was calm again, and the sun shining, the prince
and princess had disappeared.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<a name="princess_and_wolves" id="princess_and_wolves"></a>
<img src="images/ofb21.jpg" width="700" height="428"
alt="The princess and the wolves in the forest" />
</div>

<p>Although the king&rsquo;s son and daughter were the only
persons who had vanished in the storm, unluckily they
had been carried off in opposite directions. The rapid
motion through the air deprived the princess of her senses,
which she nearly lost a second time, from fright, when
she was set down alone in the middle of a thick forest.
She ran wildly about, calling to her brother to come to
her aid; but her cries only attracted the attention of some
hungry wolves, who sprung towards her with their jaws
gaping and their red tongues hanging out. Falling on
her knees, she covered her face with one hand unconsciously
grasping the collar with the other, and awaited
her doom. Already she could feel their hot breath on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
her cheek, and crouched lower and lower, when the eyes
of the foremost wolf caught sight of the collar. With a
howl that echoed through the forest he bounded away,
followed by his companions.</p>

<p>As soon as the princess had recovered from the shock
she rose and fled, without knowing whither, until she
found herself in a broad road, and beheld, approaching
her, a flock of sheep driven by two shepherds. She hastened
towards them in order to implore their help, when
suddenly the sheep caught sight of her collar and instantly
scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must have something about me which frightens all
beasts,&rsquo; she thought, and took great comfort therefrom;
and in good spirits she went her way, till she came to the
gates of an old castle. She was just about to enter and
beg for a night&rsquo;s shelter, when a snow white fox ran across
the road, and stopped in front of her.</p>

<p>He was so pretty, and had such bright beseeching eyes,
that the princess hastily tucked the collar under her dress,
lest he too should flee at the sight of it. Very gently she
drew near, hoping he might follow her into the castle, but
he only set off in another direction, and, tired though she
was, something forced the girl to follow him. Thankful
indeed was she when he turned a corner and sat down
before the door of a tiny palace, which was built on the
bank of a river. When she came up he took the hem of
her dress between his teeth and led her into a room where
there was a table covered with milk and fruit. After she
had eaten and drunk, she lay down upon a pile of cushions,
with the fox at her feet, and fell asleep to dream of her
lost brother.</p>

<p>If the princess was dreaming of her brother, he was no
less thinking of her, on the wild sea-shore, whither the
whirlwind had cast him. All was bleak and bare, except
a green island which he could only see from the top of a
high rock where he passed all his days, gazing on the waving
palm trees and glittering waterfalls in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
&lsquo;Suppose she should be there?&rsquo; he said to himself; and
though there was no reason to expect that the princess
should be in that place more than in any other, he could
not get the notion out of his head.</p>

<p>A song, sung in the loveliest voice he had ever heard,
roused the young man from his musings, and he instantly
turned in the direction from which it had come. But
though the singer seemed close to him he could see her
nowhere, and indeed, no sooner had he reached one spot
than the voice sounded in another direction, and he followed
it up and down, till he was suddenly stopped by
the sight of a large fish&rsquo;s skin, which lay stretched on the
sand between the sea and the rocks. The thing was so
ugly, that he stepped aside in disgust, and at that instant
something leapt into the sea behind his back. This
caused him to look round. The fish&rsquo;s skin was no longer
there, but in a cave in the rock behind it he discovered a
bath of ebony lined with gold, which glittered in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>Days passed without any adventures, and the prince
had almost made up his mind to leave the shore, and to
seek his sister inland, when once more he heard the
voice that had so charmed him, and beheld the bloody
skin lying on the sand, and the bath, now filled with water,
in the grotto. Little sleep had he that night, and before
dawn he hid himself behind the rocks, determined not
to move from the place till the fish should come back
again.</p>

<p>He had not very long to wait, for with the first rays of
the sun there appeared, out to sea, a shining white object
which was blown by gentle breezes towards the shore. As
it came nearer he beheld a maiden, of dazzling loveliness,
seated in a shell where blues and pinks and greens all
melted into each other. In her hand she held the rope
with which the shell was guided.</p>

<p>The prince was so bewildered at her beauty that he
forgot that he was in hiding, and, rushing out, sank on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
his knees on the sands, holding out his hands towards
this wonderful vision. But as he did so the comb and
its case fell out of his pocket, and at the sight the lady
uttered a wild shriek, and, steering her shell round, vanished
speedily in the direction of the island. Throwing
off his clothes, the prince was preparing to swim after her,
when he perceived beside him a snow white fox, looking
the same way, and making frantic signs with his paws, till
a small boat put out and set sail towards them, to the great
joy of the little creature.</p>

<p>When the boat drew up to the beach, the fox waved
his paw towards the prince&rsquo;s clothes, which he took to
mean that he was to put them on again. This done, they
both got in, and had just pushed off, when the prince
suddenly recollected that the sight of the comb had frightened
away the beautiful lady. In a transport of fury he
raised his hand to fling it into the sea, but the fox sprang
on him and held on so tightly to his arm that he could not
lift it. At that moment a horseman on the shore let fly
an arrow at the fox, with so true an aim that the little
creature fell heavily into the well of the boat, and closed
its eyes, like one who has received his death-blow. The
grief of the prince was sore. He instantly leaped to land,
but the murderer was already far distant. When the
young man turned round again, the boat and the fox were
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>An approaching storm drove him into the grotto, which
was lighted up by a multitude of tapers, each one being
in the shape of a knife half out of its sheath. Over the
bath was a tent-shaped covering of white, embroidered
with sheaths, and from beneath it came a voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Prince, will you trust me whatever happens, knowing
that my heart is yours, and as I feel that yours is mine?
But, beware, for if you give the smallest sign of fear, when
the tent is opened, you will lose me for ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did well to warn him; and even then he had
much ado to keep the colour in his cheeks and his hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
from trembling, for a crocodile&rsquo;s head with snapping jaws
advanced towards him. With a mighty effort he managed
to remain still, and to gaze steadily at the horrible beast,
and as he did so, the head bent backwards, and beneath
it was seen the lovely countenance of the Lady of the
Shell.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quick! prince! quick! the time is flying, comb me
at once or I shall vanish from your sight.&rsquo; At her words
he took out the comb, but found to his surprise that it
needed all his strength to draw it from its sheath. And,
strange to say, that in proportion as the comb emerged
from its sheath the lady&rsquo;s head was freed from its horrible
covering, and her body rose a little more out of the water.
When her shoulders and arms were freed, she called to
him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Enough, so far you have obeyed my orders. Now
burn my skin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, that I can <em>never</em> do,&rsquo; cried he; but the lady cut
him short.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then we shall both rue it for ever,&rsquo; she said gravely;
&lsquo;for I can only be the wife of him who will burn my skin.&rsquo;
And while he still stood hesitating, the curtains of the
tent fell back on her, and the tapers fizzled out.</p>

<p>Bitterly repenting his slowness, he wandered towards
the forest where a fire was burning, hardly knowing what
he did; but on his way he almost fell over the skin, which
was lying across his path.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, fool that I was! This must be the skin she wished
me to burn,&rsquo; said he. And seizing it in both hands he
flung it into the fire, where it exploded with a terrific noise.
At first he rushed off to some distance, not knowing what
might next befall, but after a while found that his steps
had led him back to the place of the fire. The skin had
gone and left no traces, but among the cinders he beheld
something shining, which proved to be the magic collar.
Ah! then his sister, for whom he had so greatly longed,
must be near at last! And before he could turn his head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
or pick up the collar, her arms were round his neck, and
everything else was forgotten.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shall tell your story first,&rsquo; she said, when at length
they could speak. And so he did; but his head was so
full of the Lady of the Shell that he forgot to say anything
about the fox. And it was well that he had forgotten,
for when the princess had poured forth her own adventures,
she ended up by speaking of all she owed to the
little white fox.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You cannot even guess the care he took of me in the
little palace. But though nothing could exceed his kindness,
I saw by his eyes that there was something he wanted
me to give him, but I could not tell what. Alas! the day
came that I learnt it to my cost. I had hidden the collar
in a thick bush, lest the fox should catch sight of it and
be scared away as the other animals had been. But, one
day, when we were in the garden, the sun happened to
shine straight on it, and he sprang towards it with every
sign of delight. He was about to seize it between his
teeth when it closed with a loud noise. The fox fled away
with a piercing scream, and though I have sought him far
and wide, I have never seen him since. I was here when
you flung the skin into the cinders, and no doubt, in my
hurry to escape, the collar must have dropped from me.
Ah, dear brother,&rsquo; she continued with tears in her eyes,
&lsquo;I can no longer live without my beloved fox; help me, I
entreat you, to find him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So great was her grief that the prince dared not tell
her what sad fate had overtaken the poor little animal,
and trusted that time might soothe her. He assured
her that he would go with her wherever she desired if
she would grant him this one day to spend on the sea-shore;
and with this the princess was forced to be
content.</p>

<p>The prince was standing on the rock, looking out towards
the lovely island, and straining his eyes to see the white
sail once more, when frightful shrieks from the wood a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
little way off caused him to hasten with all his speed in
that direction. He soon perceived a knight on horseback
with a bow slung to his back, struggling to lift a woman
on to his saddle. The knights&rsquo; surprise at the sight of a
man in this desolate spot caused him to drop the woman&rsquo;s
arm, and she rushed to take shelter behind her defender,
who, to his amazement, then recognised his step-mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How did you come here?&rsquo; he asked coldly, more than
half regretting that he had not left her to her fate; but
she read what was in his heart, and fell on her knees before
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, forgive me my wickedness,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;for indeed
I have repented of it long ago, and come to the aid of
your father who has been sorely smitten by that mad
archduke from whom you have just saved me! There is
no time to pursue him,&rsquo; she added, as the prince started
at the sound of the vanishing hoofs; and as they pushed
their way along the path she told him all that had happened
since they had last met.</p>

<p>&lsquo;From the moment that the king knew of my cruelty
to your sister,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;he vowed he would never see
me again, and left the court in search of you both. I
followed him secretly, but not being able to gain any
tidings of him, consulted the Mother of Sheaths, who
took me to rest in that island where the palm trees are
waving. There she showed me a lovely princess who,
under a spell, was forced daily to take the form of a
crocodile, and when the dreaded moment arrived the skin
appeared before her, and, shudder as she might, some
unseen power impelled her to wrap herself in it and plunge
into the sea. It is to this island I am leading you; but
first we must find your sister, for on her presence hangs
the life of the white fox&mdash;if, indeed, he is not dead
already.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The white fox!&rsquo; exclaimed the prince. &lsquo;What do you
know of him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; answered the queen; &lsquo;but, since I arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
on the island, he was always with us, and charmed us all.
Yesterday we missed him, but in the evening a little boat
drifted up on the sands, and in it lay the fox, covered with
blood. While his wounds were being tended in the palace
with all the care imaginable, I set out to consult a wizard,
who told me that I must enter the skiff and seek for the
prince and princess of Lombardy, and that if, in twenty-four
hours, I could bring them into the presence of the
fox, his life would be saved. On a rock along the beach
I found your father with an arrow through his shoulder,
from the bow of his cousin the mad archduke, who was
drawing another from his quiver, destined for me, when
I fled into the forest!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father so near!&rsquo; cried the prince. &lsquo;We must return
and seek him, and also look for my sister.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>They found her in the grotto, with her father&rsquo;s head
in her lap, trying vainly to staunch his wounds. Between
them they contrived to carry him to the boat, which
sailed swiftly towards the island. On the way the prince
gently broke to his sister the sad state of the white
fox.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take me to him!&rsquo; she said, as soon as the boat touched
the island; and in silence the queen went down the path
to the palace.</p>

<p>The white fox was lying on a soft mattress in front
of a fire, his eyes closed, and a look on his face which
told that death was not far distant. But he knew, somehow,
that the princess was near him, and opened his
eyes and wagged his tail feebly. The princess burst
into sobs and tears, till a hand on her shoulder checked
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why do you waste the few moments that are left you
in this manner?&rsquo; asked the governor of the island sternly.
&lsquo;Place the collar you wear round his neck, and he will be
cured at once. But you must act quickly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess seemed turned to stone as she listened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
&lsquo;The collar!&rsquo; she gasped. &lsquo;But I have not got it, I lost
it in the forest!&rsquo; And the thousand sheaths with which
the walls were hung took up the cry:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The collar is lost! The collar is lost!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;">
<a name="white_fox" id="white_fox"></a>
<img src="images/ofb23.jpg" width="499" height="500"
alt="The princess saves the white fox" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;What collar are you talking about?&rsquo; asked the king,
who was lying on another bed, with the physicians bending
over him. &lsquo;Here is one that I picked up among some
cinders, before that madman shot me&mdash;perhaps it may
be the one you want, or, at all events, it may do as well.&rsquo;
And he signed to an attendant to take the collar from the
pocket of his velvet jerkin.</p>

<p>The princess leapt forward with joy at the sight of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
precious thing, and snatching it from the hand of the man
she placed it round the neck of the fox. All present held
their breath as they watched what was happening; and
what <em>did</em> happen was that his legs grew longer and longer,
and his nose grew shorter and shorter. The fox was gone,
and in his stead there lay Perarthrites, in a coat of thick
white fur.</p>

<p>But though the prince of Lombardy was rejoiced to
see his friend and cousin again, his heart still bled for
the beautiful lady who had vanished so mysteriously. His
face was so troubled that the governor of the island
marked it, and asked what was the matter. &lsquo;Oh! help
me, if you can,&rsquo; cried the prince. &lsquo;The thought of the
sufferings that the enchanted nymph may be undergoing
tortures me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are far worse than you can imagine,&rsquo; gravely
replied the governor; &lsquo;but if you still possess your comb,
you may yet relieve her of them. Ah! that is well,&rsquo; he
continued, as the prince quickly drew the comb from its
case. &lsquo;Now follow me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Not only the prince, but every one else followed; and
the governor led them down a long gallery to a heavy
iron door, which flew open at its own accord. But what
a sight met the prince&rsquo;s eyes! The lady whom he had
last beheld in peerless beauty was sitting in a chair wrapped
in flames, which were twisting like hair about her head.
Her face was swollen and red; her mouth was open as if
gasping for breath. Only her arms and neck were as
lovely as ever in their whiteness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is your doing,&rsquo; said the governor to the prince;
&lsquo;you brought her to this when you burnt the crocodile&rsquo;s
skin. Now try if, by combing, you can soothe her
agony.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the first touch of the comb the flames became
suddenly extinguished; at the second, the look of pain
vanished from the face, and it shrank into its usual size;
at the third, she rose from the chair, lovelier than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
ever was before, and flung herself into the arms of her
brother Perarthrites.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>After this there was nothing more to be done but to
marry the two couples as fast as possible. And when
the wedding was over, Perarthrites and his bride returned
to Placenza, and Ferrandina and her husband to Lombardy,
and they all lived happily till they died.</p>

<h2><i>THE THANKSGIVING OF THE WAZIR</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in Hindustan two kings
whose countries bordered upon each other; but, as they
were rivals in wealth and power, and one was a Hindu
rajah and the other a Mohammedan b&acirc;dshah, they were
not good friends at all. In order, however, to escape
continual quarrels, the rajah and the b&acirc;dshah had drawn
up an agreement, stamped and signed, declaring that if
any of their subjects, from the least to the greatest, crossed
the boundary between the two kingdoms, he might be seized
and punished.</p>

<p>One morning the b&acirc;dshah and his chief wazir, or prime
minister, were just about to begin their morning&rsquo;s work
over the affairs of the kingdom, and the b&acirc;dshah had
taken up a pen and was cutting it to his liking with a sharp
knife, when the knife slipped and cut off the tip of his
finger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh-he, wazir!&rsquo; cried the king, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve cut the tip of my
finger off!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is good hearing!&rsquo; said the wazir in answer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Insolent one,&rsquo; exclaimed the king. &lsquo;Do you take
pleasure in the misfortunes of others, and in mine
also? Take him away, my guards, and put him in
the court prison until I have time to punish him as he
deserves!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the officers in attendance seized upon the
luckless wazir, and dragged him out of the king&rsquo;s presence
towards the narrow doorway, through which unhappy
criminals were wont to be led to prison or execution. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
the door opened to receive him, the wazir muttered something
into his great white beard which the soldiers could
not hear.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What said the rascal?&rsquo; shouted the angry king.</p>

<p>He says, &lsquo;he thanks your majesty,&rsquo; replied one of the
gaolers. And at his words, the king stared at the closing
door, in anger and amazement.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He must be mad,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;for he is grateful, not
only for the misfortunes of others, but for his own;
surely something has turned his head!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the king was very fond of his old wazir, and
although the court physician came and bound up his
injured finger with cool and healing ointment, and
soothed the pain, he could not soothe the soreness of the
king&rsquo;s heart, nor could any of all his ministers and
courtiers, who found his majesty very cross all the day
long.</p>

<p>Early next morning the king ordered his horse and
declared that he would go hunting. Instantly all was
bustle and preparation in stable and hall, and by the
time he was ready a score of ministers and huntsmen
stood ready to mount and accompany him; but to their
astonishment the king would have none of them. Indeed,
he glared at them so fiercely that they were
glad to leave him. So away and away he wandered,
over field and through forest, so moody and thoughtful
that many a fat buck and gaudy pheasant escaped
without notice, and so careless was he whither he was
going that he strayed without perceiving it over into the
rajah&rsquo;s territory, and only discovered the fact when,
suddenly, men stepped from all sides out of a thicket,
and there was nothing left but surrender. Then the
poor b&acirc;dshah was seized and bound and taken to the
rajah&rsquo;s prison, thinking most of the time of his wazir,
who was suffering a similar fate, and wishing that, like
the wazir, he could feel that there was something to give
thanks for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
That night the rajah held a special council to consider
what should be done to his rival who had thus given himself
into his hands. All the Brahmans were sent for&mdash;fat
priests who understood all about everything, and what
days were lucky and what unlucky&mdash;and, whilst all the
rest of the rajah&rsquo;s councillors were offering him different
advice until he was nearly crazy with anger and indecision,
the chief Brahman was squatting in a corner figuring out
sums and signs to himself with an admiring group of lesser
priests around him. At last he arose, and advanced
towards the throne.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the rajah anxiously, &lsquo;what have you to
advise?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A very unlucky day!&rsquo; exclaimed the chief Brahman.
&lsquo;Oh, a very unlucky day! The god Devi is full of wrath,
and commands that to-morrow you must chop off this
b&acirc;dshah&rsquo;s head and offer it in to him in sacrifice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; said the rajah, &lsquo;let it be done. I leave it
to you to carry out the sentence.&rsquo; And he bowed to the
priests and left the room.</p>

<p>Before dawn great preparations were being made for
a grand festival in honour of the great idol Devi. Hundreds
of banners waved, hundreds of drummers drummed,
hundreds of singers chanted chants, hundreds of priests,
well washed and anointed, performed their sacred rites,
whilst the rajah sat, nervous and ill at ease, amongst hundreds
of courtiers and servants, wishing it were all well
over. At last the time came for the sacrifice to be offered,
and the poor b&acirc;dshah was led out bound, to have his head
chopped off.</p>

<p>The chief Brahman came along with a smile on his
face, and a big sword in his hand, when, suddenly, he
noticed that the b&acirc;dshah&rsquo;s finger was tied up in a bit of
rag. Instantly he dropped the sword, and, with his eyes
starting out of his head with excitement, pounced upon
the rag and tore it off, and there he saw that the tip of
his victim&rsquo;s finger was missing. At this he got very red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
and angry indeed, and he led the b&acirc;dshah up to where the
rajah sat wondering.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Behold! O rajah,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this sacrifice is useless,
the tip of his finger is gone! A sacrifice is no sacrifice
unless it is complete.&rsquo; And he began to weep with rage
and mortification.</p>

<p>But of instead of wailing likewise, the rajah gave a sigh
of relief, and answered: &lsquo;Well, that settles the matter.
If it had been anyone else I should not have minded; but,
somehow&mdash;a king and all&mdash;well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite
right to sacrifice a king.&rsquo; And with that he jumped up
and with his jewelled dagger cut the b&acirc;dshah&rsquo;s cords,
and marched with him out of the temple back to the
palace.</p>

<p>After having bathed and refreshed his guest, the rajah
loaded him with gifts, and himself accompanied him with
a large escort as far as the frontier between their kingdoms,
where, amidst salutes and great rejoicings, they tore up
the old agreement and drew up another in which each
king promised welcome and safe conduct to any of the
other&rsquo;s people, from the least to the greatest, who came
over the border on any errand whatever. And so they
embraced, and each went his own way.</p>

<p>When the b&acirc;dshah got home that very evening he sent
for his imprisoned wazir.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, O wazir!&rsquo; he said, when the old man had been
brought before him, &lsquo;what think you has been happening
to me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can a man in prison know what is happening
outside it?&rsquo; answered the wazir.</p>

<p>Then the b&acirc;dshah told him all his adventures. And
when he had reached the end he added:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have made up my mind, as a token of gratitude
for my escape, to pardon you freely, if you will tell me
why you gave thanks when I cut off the tip of my
finger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; replied the old wazir, &lsquo;am I not right in thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
that it was a very lucky thing for you that you <em>did</em> cut off
the tip of your finger, for otherwise you would certainly
have lost your head. And to lose a scrap of one&rsquo;s finger
is surely the least of the two evils.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very true,&rsquo; answered the king, touching his head as he
spoke, as if to make quite certain that it was still there,
&lsquo;but yet&mdash;why did you likewise give thanks when I put
you into prison?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I gave thanks,&rsquo; said the wazir, &lsquo;because it is good always
to give thanks. And had I known that my being in prison
was to prevent the god Devi claiming me instead of your
majesty, as a perfect offering, I should have given greater
thanks still.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>SAMBA THE COWARD</i></h2>


<p>In the great country far away south, through which flows
the river Nile, there lived a king who had an only child
called Samba.</p>

<p>Now, from the time that Samba could walk he
showed signs of being afraid of everything, and as he
grew bigger he became more and more frightened. At
first his father&rsquo;s friends made light of it, and said to each
other:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is strange to see a boy of our race running into a
hut at the trumpeting of an elephant, and trembling with
fear if a lion cub half his size comes near him; but, after
all, he is only a baby, and when he is older he will be as
brave as the rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, he is only a baby,&rsquo; answered the king who overheard
them, &lsquo;it will be all right by-and-by.&rsquo; But, somehow,
he sighed as he said it, and the men looked at him and
made no reply.</p>

<p>The years passed away, and Samba had become a tall
and strong youth. He was good-natured and pleasant,
and was liked by all, and if during his father&rsquo;s hunting
parties he was seldom to be seen in any place
of danger, he was too great a favourite for much to be
said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When the king holds the feast and declares him to be
his heir, he will cease to be a child,&rsquo; murmured the rest
of the people, as they had done before; and on the day of
the ceremony their hearts beat gladly, and they cried to
each other:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is Samba, Samba, whose chin is above the heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
of other men, who will defend us against the tribes of
the robbers!&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Not many weeks after, the dwellers in the village awoke
to find that during the night their herds had been driven
away, and their herdsmen carried off into slavery by their
enemies. Now was the time for Samba to show the brave
spirit that had come to him with his manhood, and to ride
forth at the head of the warriors of his race. But Samba
could nowhere be found, and a party of the avengers went
on their way without him.</p>

<p>It was many days later before he came back, with his
head held high, and a tale of a lion which he had tracked
to its lair and killed, at the risk of his own life. A little
while earlier and his people would have welcomed his
story, and believed it all, but now it was too late.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Samba the Coward,&rsquo; cried a voice from the crowd;
and the name stuck to him, even the very children
shouted it at him, and his father did not spare him. At
length he could bear it no longer, and made up his
mind to leave his own land for another where peace
had reigned since the memory of man. So, early next
morning, he slipped out to the king&rsquo;s stables, and
choosing the quietest horse he could find, he rode away
northwards.</p>

<p>Never as long as he lived did Samba forget the terrors
of that journey. He could hardly sleep at night for dread
of the wild beasts that might be lurking behind every rock
or bush, while, by day, the distant roar of a lion would
cause him to start so violently, that he almost fell from
his horse. A dozen times he was on the point of turning
back, and it was not the terror of the mocking words and
scornful laughs that kept him from doing so, but the terror
lest he should be forced to take part in their wars. Therefore
he held on, and deeply thankful he felt when the walls
of a city, larger than he had ever dreamed of, rose before
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
Drawing himself up to his full height, he rode proudly
through the gate and past the palace, where, as was her
custom, the princess was sitting on the terrace roof, watching
the bustle in the street below.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a gallant figure,&rsquo; thought she, as Samba, mounted
on his big black horse, steered his way skilfully among the
crowds; and, beckoning to a slave, she ordered him to go
and meet the stranger, and ask him who he was and whence
he came.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, princess, he is the son of a king, and heir to a country
which lies near the Great River,&rsquo; answered the slave,
when he had returned from questioning Samba. And the
princess on hearing this news summoned her father, and
told him that if she was not allowed to wed the stranger
she would die unmarried.</p>

<p>Like many other fathers, the king could refuse his
daughter nothing, and besides, she had rejected so many
suitors already that he was quite alarmed lest no man
should be good enough for her. Therefore, after a talk
with Samba, who charmed him by his good humour and
pleasant ways, he gave his consent, and three days
later the wedding feast was celebrated with the utmost
splendour.</p>

<p>The princess was very proud of her tall handsome
husband, and for some time she was quite content that
he should pass the days with her under the palm trees,
telling her the stories that she loved, or amusing her with
tales of the manners and customs of his country, which
were so different to those of her own. But, by-and-by,
this was not enough; she wanted other people to be proud
of him too, and one day she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I really almost wish that those Moorish thieves from
the north would come on one of their robbing expeditions.
I should love so to see you ride out at the head of our men,
to chase them home again. Ah, how happy I should be
when the city rang with your noble deeds!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
She looked lovingly at him as she spoke; but, to her
surprise, his face grew dark, and he answered hastily:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never speak to me again of the Moors or of war. It
was to escape from them that I fled from my own land,
and at the first word of invasion I should leave you for
ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How funny you are,&rsquo; cried she, breaking into a
laugh. &lsquo;The idea of anyone as big as you being afraid
of a Moor! But still, you mustn&rsquo;t say those things to
anyone except me, or they might think you were in
earnest.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Not very long after this, when the people of the city
were holding a great feast outside the walls of the
town, a body of Moors, who had been in hiding for
days, drove off all the sheep and goats which were peacefully
feeding on the slopes of a hill. Directly the loss
was discovered, which was not for some hours, the king
gave orders that the war drum should be beaten, and
the warriors assembled in the great square before the
palace, trembling with fury at the insult which had
been put upon them. Loud were the cries for instant
vengeance, and for Samba, son-in-law of the king, to
lead them to battle. But shout as they might, Samba
never came.</p>

<p>And where was he? No further than in a cool, dark
cellar of the palace, crouching among huge earthenware
pots of grain. With a rush of pain at her heart, there his
wife found him, and she tried with all her strength to
kindle in him a sense of shame, but in vain. Even the
thought of the future danger he might run from the contempt
of his subjects was as nothing when compared with
the risks of the present.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take off your tunic of mail,&rsquo; said the princess at last;
and her voice was so stern and cold that none would have
known it. &lsquo;Give it to me, and hand me besides your
helmet, your sword and your spear.&rsquo; And with many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
fearful glances to right and to left, Samba stripped off
the armour inlaid with gold, the property of the king&rsquo;s
son-in-law. Silently his wife took, one by one, the pieces
from him, and fastened them on her with firm hands,
never even glancing at the tall form of her husband who
had slunk back to his corner. When she had fastened
the last buckle, and lowered her vizor, she went out, and
mounting Samba&rsquo;s horse, gave the signal to the warriors
to follow.</p>

<p>Now, although the princess was much shorter than her
husband, she was a tall woman, and the horse which she
rode was likewise higher than the rest, so that when the
men caught sight of the gold-inlaid suit of chain armour,
they did not doubt that Samba was taking his rightful
place, and cheered him loudly. The princess bowed in
answer to their greeting, but kept her vizor down; and
touching her horse with the spur, she galloped at the head
of her troops to charge the enemy. The Moors, who
had not expected to be so quickly pursued, had scarcely
time to form themselves into battle array, and were speedily
put to flight. Then the little troop of horsemen returned
to the city, where all sung the praises of Samba their
leader.</p>

<p>The instant they reached the palace the princess flung
her reins to a groom, and disappeared up a side staircase,
by which she could, unseen, enter her own rooms. Here
she found Samba lying idly on a heap of mats; but he
raised his head uneasily as the door opened and looked
at his wife, not feeling sure how she might act towards
him. However, he need not have been afraid of harsh
words: she merely unbuttoned her armour as fast as possible,
and bade him put it on with all speed. Samba
obeyed, not daring to ask any questions; and when he had
finished the princess told him to follow her, and led him
on to the flat roof of the house, below which a crowd had
gathered, cheering lustily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Samba, the king&rsquo;s son-in-law! Samba, the bravest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
of the brave! Where is he? Let him show himself!&rsquo;
And when Samba did show himself the shouts and
applause became louder than ever. &lsquo;See how modest
he is! He leaves the glory to others!&rsquo; cried they. And
Samba only smiled and waved his hand, and said
nothing.</p>

<p>Out of all the mass of people assembled there to do
honour to Samba, one alone there was who did not
shout and praise with the rest. This was the princess&rsquo;s
youngest brother, whose sharp eyes had noted certain
things during the fight which recalled his sister much
more than they did her husband. Under promise of
secrecy, he told his suspicions to the other princes, but
only got laughed at, and was bidden to carry his dreams
elsewhere.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; answered the boy, &lsquo;we shall see who is
right; but the next time we give battle to the Moors
I will take care to place a private mark on our commander.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In spite of their defeat, not many days after the Moors
sent a fresh body of troops to steal some cattle, and again
Samba&rsquo;s wife dressed herself in her husband&rsquo;s armour,
and rode out at the head of the avenging column. This
time the combat was fiercer than before, and in the thick
of it her youngest brother drew near, and gave his sister
a slight wound on the leg. At the moment she paid no
heed to the pain, which, indeed, she scarcely felt; but
when the enemy had been put to flight and the little band
returned to the palace, faintness suddenly overtook her,
and she could hardly stagger up the staircase to her own
apartments.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am wounded,&rsquo; she cried, sinking down on the mats
where he had been lying, &lsquo;but do not be anxious; it is
really nothing. You have only got to wound yourself
slightly in the same spot and no one will guess that it was
I and not you who were fighting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried Samba, his eyes nearly starting from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
his head in surprise and terror. &lsquo;Can you possibly
imagine that I should agree to anything so useless and
painful? Why, I might as well have gone to fight
myself!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, I ought to have known better, indeed,&rsquo; answered
the princess, in a voice that seemed to come from a long
way off; but, quick as thought, the moment Samba
turned his back she pierced one of his bare legs with a
spear.</p>

<p>He gave a loud scream and staggered backwards, from
astonishment, much more than from pain. But before
he could speak his wife had left the room and had gone
to seek the medicine man of the palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My husband has been wounded,&rsquo; said she, when she
had found him, &lsquo;come and tend him with speed, for he is
faint from loss of blood.&rsquo; And she took care that more
than one person heard her words, so that all that day the
people pressed up to the gate of the palace, asking for
news of their brave champion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; observed the king&rsquo;s eldest sons, who had
visited the room where Samba lay groaning, &lsquo;you see,
O wise young brother, that we were right and you were
wrong about Samba, and that he really <em>did</em> go into the
battle.&rsquo; But the boy answered nothing, and only shook his
head doubtfully.</p>

<p>It was only two days later that the Moors appeared
for the third time, and though the herds had been tethered
in a new and safer place, they were promptly carried off
as before. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said the Moors to each other, &lsquo;the tribe
will never think of our coming back so soon when they
have beaten us so badly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the drum sounded to assemble all the fighting
men, the princess rose and sought her husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Samba,&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;my wound is worse than I thought.
I can scarcely walk, and could not mount my horse without
help. For to-day, then, I cannot do your work, so you
must go instead of me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
&lsquo;What nonsense,&rsquo; exclaimed Samba, &lsquo;I never heard
of such a thing. Why, I might be wounded, or even
killed! You have three brothers. The king can choose
one of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are all too young,&rsquo; replied his wife; &lsquo;the men
would not obey them. But if, indeed, you will not go,
at least you can help me harness my horse.&rsquo; And to this
Samba, who was always ready to do anything he was
asked when there was no danger about it, agreed
readily.</p>

<p>So the horse was quickly harnessed, and when it was
done the princess said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now ride the horse to the place of meeting outside
the gates, and I will join you by a shorter way, and will
change places with you.&rsquo; Samba, who loved riding in
times of peace, mounted as she had told him, and when
he was safe in the saddle, his wife dealt the horse a sharp
cut with her whip, and he dashed off through the town
and through the ranks of the warriors who were waiting
for him. Instantly the whole place was in motion. Samba
tried to check his steed, but he might as well have sought
to stop the wind, and it seemed no more than a few
minutes before they were grappling hand to hand with
the Moors.</p>

<p>Then a miracle happened. Samba the coward, the
skulker, the terrified, no sooner found himself pressed
hard, unable to escape, than something sprang into life
within him, and he fought with all his might. And when
a man of his size and strength begins to fight he generally
fights well.</p>

<p>That day the victory was really owing to Samba, and
the shouts of the people were louder than ever. When
he returned, bearing with him the sword of the Moorish
chief, the old king pressed him in his arms and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my son, how can I ever show you how grateful
I am for this splendid service?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
But Samba, who was good and loyal when fear did not
possess him, answered straightly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father, it is to your daughter and not to me to whom
thanks are due, for it is she who has turned the coward
that I was into a brave man.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>KUPTI AND IMANI</i></h2>


<p>Once there was a king who had two daughters; and their
names were Kupti and Imani. He loved them both very
much, and spent hours in talking to them, and one day
he said to Kupti, the elder:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you satisfied to leave your life and fortune in my
hands?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Verily yes,&rsquo; answered the princess, surprised at the
question. &lsquo;In whose hands should I leave them, if not
in yours?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But when he asked his younger daughter Imani the
same question, she replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, indeed! If I had the chance I would make my
own fortune.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this answer the king was very displeased, and
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are too young to know the meaning of your words.
But, be it so; I will give you the chance of gratifying your
wish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he sent for an old lame fakir who lived in a tumbledown
hut on the outskirts of the city, and when he had
presented himself, the king said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No doubt, as you are very old and nearly crippled,
you would be glad of some young person to live with
you and serve you; so I will send you my younger
daughter. She wants to earn her living, and she can
do so with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of course the old fakir had not a word to say, or, if
he had, he was really too astonished and troubled to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
it; but the young princess went off with him smiling, and
tripped along quite gaily, whilst he hobbled home with her
in perplexed silence.</p>

<p>Directly they got to the hut the fakir began to think
what he could arrange for the princess&rsquo;s comfort; but
after all he was a fakir, and his house was bare except
for one bedstead, two old cooking pots and an earthen
jar for water, and one cannot get much comfort out of
those things. However, the princess soon ended his perplexity
by asking:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you any money?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have a penny somewhere,&rsquo; replied the fakir.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; rejoined the princess, &lsquo;give me the penny
and go out and borrow me a spinning-wheel and a
loom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After much seeking the fakir found the penny and
started on his errand, whilst the princess went off shopping.
First she bought a farthing&rsquo;s worth of oil, and
then she bought three farthings&rsquo; worth of flax. When
she got back with her purchases she set the old man on
the bedstead and rubbed his crippled leg with the oil for
an hour. Then she sat down to the spinning-wheel and
spun and spun all night long whilst the old man slept,
until, in the morning, she had spun the finest thread that
ever was seen. Next she went to the loom and wove and
wove until by the evening she had woven a beautiful silver
cloth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said she to the fakir, &lsquo;go into the market-place
and sell my cloth whilst I rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what am I to ask for it?&rsquo; said the old man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Two gold pieces,&rsquo; replied the princess.</p>

<p>So the fakir hobbled away, and stood in the market-place
to sell the cloth. Presently the elder princess drove
by, and when she saw the cloth she stopped and asked
the price.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Two gold pieces,&rsquo; said the fakir. And the princess
gladly paid them, after which the old fakir hobbled home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
with the money. As she had done before so Imani
did again day after day. Always she spent a penny upon
oil and flax, always she tended the old man&rsquo;s lame limb,
and spun and wove the most beautiful cloths and sold
them at high prices. Gradually the city became famous
for her beautiful stuffs, the old fakir&rsquo;s lame leg became
straighter and stronger, and the hole under the floor
of the hut where they kept their money became fuller
and fuller of gold pieces. At last, one day, the princess
said:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="imani_attends" id="imani_attends"></a>
<img src="images/ofb25.jpg" width="500" height="490"
alt="Imani attends to the crippled fakir" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I really think we have got enough to live in greater
comfort.&rsquo; And she sent for builders, and they built a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
beautiful house for her and the old fakir, and in all the
city there was none finer except the king&rsquo;s palace.
Presently this reached the ears of the king, and when
he inquired whose it was they told him that it belonged
to his daughter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; exclaimed the king, &lsquo;she said that she would
make her own fortune, and somehow or other she seems
to have done it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A little while after this, business took the king to
another country, and before he went he asked his elder
daughter what she would like him to bring her back as
a gift.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A necklace of rubies,&rsquo; answered she. And then the
king thought he would like to ask Imani too; so he sent
a messenger to find out what sort of a present she wanted.
The man happened to arrive just as she was trying to
disentangle a knot in her loom, and bowing low before
her, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The king sends me to inquire what you wish him to
bring you as a present from the country of D&ucirc;r?&rsquo; But
Imani, who was only considering how she could best untie
the knot without breaking the thread, replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Patience!&rsquo; meaning that the messenger should wait till
she was able to attend to him. But the messenger went
off with this as an answer, and told the king that the only
thing the princess Imani wanted was &lsquo;patience.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s a
thing to be bought at D&ucirc;r; I never had it myself, but if it
is to be got I will buy it for her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next day the king departed on his journey, and when
his business at D&ucirc;r was completed he bought for Kupti a
beautiful ruby necklace. Then he said to a servant:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The princess Imani wants some patience. I did not
know there was such a thing, but you must go to the market
and inquire, and if any is to be sold, get it and bring it
to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The servant saluted and left the king&rsquo;s presence. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
walked about the market for some time crying: &lsquo;Has
anyone patience to sell? patience to sell?&rsquo; And some
of the people mocked, and some (who had no patience)
told him to go away and not be a fool; and some
said: &lsquo;The fellow&rsquo;s mad! As though one could buy or
sell patience!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At length it came to the ears of the king of D&ucirc;r that
there was a madman in the market trying to buy patience.
And the king laughed and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should like to see that fellow, bring him here!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And immediately his attendants went to seek the man,
and brought him to the king, who asked:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is this you want?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the man replied: &lsquo;Sire! I am bidden to ask for
patience.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;you must have a strange master!
What does he want with it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My master wants it as a present for his daughter Imani,&rsquo;
replied the servant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;I know of some patience which
the young lady might have if she cares for it; but it is not
to be bought.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the king&rsquo;s name was Subbar Khan, and Subbar
<em>means</em> &lsquo;patience&rsquo;; but the messenger did not know that,
or understand that he was making a joke. However, he
declared that the princess Imani was not only young and
beautiful, but also the cleverest, most industrious, and
kindest-hearted of princesses; and he would have gone
on explaining her virtues had not the king laughingly put
up his hand and stopped him saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, well, wait a minute, and I will see what can be
done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With that he got up and went to his own apartments
and took out a little casket. Into the casket he put a fan,
and shutting it up carefully he brought it to the messenger
and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here is a casket. It has no lock nor key, and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
will open only to the touch of the person who needs its
contents&mdash;and whoever opens it will obtain patience;
but I can&rsquo;t tell whether it will be quite the kind of
patience that is wanted.&rsquo; And the servant bowed low,
and took the casket; but when he asked what was to be
paid, the king would take nothing. So he went away and
gave the casket and an account of his adventures to his
master.</p>

<p>As soon as their father got back to his country Kupti
and Imani each got the presents he had brought for them.
Imani was very surprised when the casket was brought to
her by the hand of a messenger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;what is this? I never asked for anything!
Indeed I had no time, for the messenger ran away
before I had unravelled my tangle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the servant declared that the casket was for her,
so she took it with some curiosity, and brought it to the
old fakir. The old man tried to open it, but in vain&mdash;so
closely did the lid fit that it seemed to be quite immovable,
and yet there was no lock, nor bolt, nor spring, nor anything
apparently by which the casket was kept shut. When
he was tired of trying he handed the casket to the princess,
who hardly touched it before it opened quite easily, and
there lay within a beautiful fan. With a cry of surprise
and pleasure Imani took out the fan, and began to
fan herself.</p>

<p>Hardly had she finished three strokes of the fan before
there suddenly appeared from nowhere in particular, king
Subbar Khan of D&ucirc;r! The princess gasped and rubbed
her eyes, and the old fakir sat and gazed in such astonishment
that for some minutes he could not speak. At length
he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who may you be, fair sir, if you please?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My name,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;is Subbar Khan of D&ucirc;r.
This lady,&rsquo; bowing to the princess, &lsquo;has summoned me,
and here I am!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I?&rsquo;&mdash;stammered the princess&mdash;&lsquo;I have summoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
you? I never saw or heard of you in my life before, so
how could that be?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king told them how he had heard of a man
in his own city of D&ucirc;r trying to buy patience, and how he
had given him the fan in the casket.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Both are magical,&rsquo; he added; &lsquo;when anyone uses the
fan, in three strokes of it I am with them; if they fold it
and tap it on the table, in three taps I am at home again.
The casket will not open to all, but you see it was this
fair lady who asked for patience, and, as that is my name,
here I am, very much at her service.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the princess Imani, being of a high spirit, was
anxious to fold up the fan, and give the three taps which
would send the king home again; but the old fakir was
very pleased with his guest, and so in one way and another
they spent quite a pleasant evening together before Subbar
Khan took his leave.</p>

<p>After that he was often summoned; and as both the
fakir and he were very fond of chess and were good players,
they used to sit up half the night playing, and at last a
little room in the house began to be called the king&rsquo;s room,
and whenever he stayed late he used to sleep there and go
home again in the morning.</p>

<p>By-and-by it came to the ears of the princess Kupti
that there was a rich and handsome young man visiting
at her sister&rsquo;s house, and she was very jealous. So she
went one day to pay Imani a visit, and pretended to be
very affectionate, and interested in the house, and in the
way in which Imani and the old fakir lived, and of their
mysterious and royal visitor. As the sisters went from
place to place, Kupti was shown Subbar Khan&rsquo;s room;
and presently, making some excuse, she slipped in there
by herself and swiftly spread under the sheet which lay
upon the bed a quantity of very finely powdered and
splintered glass which was poisoned, and which she had
brought with her concealed in her clothes. Shortly afterwards
she took leave of her sister, declaring that she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
never forgive herself for not having come near her all this
time, and that she would now begin to make amends for
her neglect.</p>

<p>That very evening Subbar Khan came and sat up late
with the old fakir playing chess as usual. Very tired,
he at length bade him and the princess good-night and,
as soon as he lay down on the bed, thousands of tiny,
tiny splinters of poisoned glass ran into him. He could
not think what was the matter, and started this way
and that until he was pricked all over, and he felt as
though he were burning from head to foot. But he never
said a word, only he sat up all night in agony of body
and in worse agony of mind to think that he should have
been poisoned, as he guessed he was, in Imani&rsquo;s own
house. In the morning, although he was nearly fainting,
he still said nothing, and by means of the magic fan was
duly transported home again. Then he sent for all the
physicians and doctors in his kingdom, but none could
make out what his illness was; and so he lingered on for
weeks and weeks trying every remedy that anyone could
devise, and passing sleepless nights and days of pain and
fever and misery, until at last he was at the point of
death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princess Imani and the old fakir were
much troubled because, although they waved the magic
fan again and again, no Subbar Khan appeared, and they
feared that he had tired of them, or that some evil fate
had overtaken him. At last the princess was in such a
miserable state of doubt and uncertainty that she determined
to go herself to the kingdom of D&ucirc;r and see what
was the matter. Disguising herself in man&rsquo;s clothes as a
young fakir, she set out upon her journey alone and on
foot, as a fakir should travel. One evening she found
herself in a forest, and lay down under a great tree to
pass the night. But she could not sleep for thinking of
Subbar Khan, and wondering what had happened to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
Presently she heard two great monkeys talking to one
another in the tree above her head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, brother,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;whence come you&mdash;and
what is the news?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">
<a name="imani_listens" id="imani_listens"></a>
<img src="images/ofb26.jpg" width="439" height="500"
alt="Imani listens to what the monkeys say" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I come from D&ucirc;r,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;and the news is
that the king is dying.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the first, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that, for he is
a master hand at slaying leopards and creatures that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
ought not to be allowed to live. What is the matter
with him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No man knows,&rsquo; replied the second monkey, &lsquo;but the
birds, who see all and carry all messages, say that he is
dying of poisoned glass that Kupti the king&rsquo;s daughter
spread upon his bed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the first monkey, &lsquo;that is sad news; but if
they only knew it, the berries of the very tree we sit in,
steeped in hot water, will cure such a disease as that in
three days at most.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;True!&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a pity that we can&rsquo;t tell
some man of a medicine so simple, and so save a good
man&rsquo;s life. But men are so silly; they go and shut themselves
up in stuffy houses in stuffy cities instead of living
in nice airy trees, and so they miss knowing all the best
things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now when Imani heard that Subbar Khan was dying
she began to weep silently; but as she listened she dried
her tears and sat up; and as soon as daylight dawned
over the forest she began to gather the berries from the
tree until she had filled her cloth with a load of them.
Then she walked on as fast as she could, and in two days
reached the city of D&ucirc;r. The first thing she did was to
pass through the market crying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Medicine for sale! Are any ill that need my medicine?&rsquo;
And presently one man said to his neighbour:</p>

<p>&lsquo;See, there is a young fakir with medicine for sale, perhaps
he could do something for the king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; replied the other, &lsquo;where so many grey-beards
have failed, how should a lad like that be of any
use?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; said the first, &lsquo;he might try.&rsquo; And he went up
and spoke to Imani, and together they set out for the palace
and announced that another doctor was come to try and
cure the king.</p>

<p>After some delay Imani was admitted to the sick room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
and, whilst <em>she</em> was so well disguised that the king did
not recognize her, <em>he</em> was so wasted by illness that she
hardly knew <em>him</em>. But she began at once, full of hope,
by asking for some apartments all to herself and a pot in
which to boil water. As soon as the water was heated
she steeped some of her berries in it and gave the mixture
to the king&rsquo;s attendants and told them to wash his body
with it. The first washing did so much good that the
king slept quietly all the night. Again the second day
she did the same, and this time the king declared he was
hungry, and called for food. After the third day he was
quite well, only very weak from his long illness. On the
fourth day he got up and sat upon his throne, and
then sent messengers to fetch the physician who had
cured him. When Imani appeared everyone marvelled
that so young a man should be so clever a doctor; and
the king wanted to give him immense presents of money
and of all kinds of precious things. At first Imani would
take nothing, but at last she said that, if she must be rewarded,
she would ask for the king&rsquo;s signet ring and his
handkerchief. So, as she would take nothing more, the
king gave her his signet ring and his handkerchief, and
she departed and travelled back to her own country as fast
as she could.</p>

<p>A little while after her return, when she had related
to the fakir all her adventures, they sent for Subbar Khan
by means of the magic fan; and when he appeared they
asked him why he had stayed away for so long. Then
he told them all about his illness, and how he had been
cured, and when he had finished the princess rose up and,
opening a cabinet, brought out the ring and handkerchief,
and said, laughing:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are these the rewards you gave to your doctor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At that the king looked, and he recognised her, and
understood in a moment all that had happened; and he
jumped up and put the magic fan in his pocket, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
declared that no one should send him away to his own country
any more unless Imani would come with him and be his
wife. And so it was settled, and the old fakir and Imani
went to the city of D&ucirc;r, where Imani was married to the
king and lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2><i>THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF LITTLE MAIA</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a pretty
cottage and garden right in the middle of a forest. All
through the summer she was quite happy tending her
flowers and listening to the birds singing in the trees, but
in the winter, when snow lay on the ground and wolves
came howling about the door, she felt very lonely and
frightened. &lsquo;If I only had a child to speak to, however
small, what a comfort it would be!&rsquo; she said to herself.
And the heavier the snow fell the oftener she repeated
the words. And at last a day arrived when she could
bear the silence and solitude no longer, and set off to walk
to the nearest village to beg someone to sell her or lend
her a child.</p>

<p>The snow was very deep, and reached above her ankles,
and it took her almost an hour to go a few hundred
yards.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will be dark at this rate before I get to the first house,&rsquo;
thought she, and stopped to look about her. Suddenly a
little woman in a high-crowned hat stepped from behind
a tree in front of her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is a bad day for walking! Are you going far?&rsquo;
inquired the little woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I want to go to the village; but I don&rsquo;t see how
I am ever to get there,&rsquo; answered the other.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And may I ask what important business takes you
there?&rsquo; asked the little woman, who was really a witch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
&lsquo;My house is so dreary, with no one to speak to; I
cannot stay in it alone, and I am seeking for a child&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t mind how small she is&mdash;who will keep me company.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, if that is all, you need go no further,&rsquo; replied the
witch, putting her hand in her pocket. &lsquo;Look, here is
a barley corn, as a favour you shall have it for twelve
shillings, and if you plant it in a flower-pot, and give it
plenty of water, in a few days you will see something
wonderful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This promise raised the woman&rsquo;s spirits. She gladly
paid down the price, and as soon as she returned home
she dug a hole in a flower-pot and put in the seed.</p>

<p>For three days she waited, hardly taking her eyes from
the flower-pot in its warm corner, and on the third morning
she saw that, while she was asleep, a tall red tulip had
shot up, sheathed in green leaves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a beautiful blossom,&rsquo; cried the woman, stooping
to kiss it, when, as she did so, the red petals burst asunder,
and in the midst of them was a lovely little girl only an
inch high. This tiny little creature was seated on a mattress
of violets, and covered with a quilt of rose leaves,
and she opened her eyes and smiled at the woman as if
she had known her all her life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! you darling; I shall never be lonely any more!&rsquo;
she exclaimed in rapture; and the baby nodded her head
as much as to say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, of course you won&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The woman lost no time in seeking for a roomy
walnut-shell, which she lined thickly with white satin,
and on it she placed the mattress, with the child, whom
she called Maia, upon it. This was her bed, and stood
on a chair close to where her foster-mother was sleeping;
but in the morning she was lifted out, and placed on a
leaf in the middle of a large bowl of water, and given
two white horse-hairs to row herself about with. She
was the happiest baby that ever was seen, and passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
the whole day singing to herself, in a language of her own,
that nobody else could understand.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>For some weeks the two lived together and never grew
tired of each other&rsquo;s society, and then a terrible misfortune
happened. One night, when the foster-mother lay sound
asleep after a hard day&rsquo;s work, a big, ugly, wet frog hopped
in through the open window and stood staring at Maia
under her quilt of rose leaves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear me! that is quite a pretty little girl,&rsquo; thought
the frog to herself; &lsquo;she would make a nice wife for my
son.&rsquo; And picking up the walnut cradle in her mouth,
she hopped with it to the edge of a stream which ran through
the garden.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come and see what I have brought you,&rsquo; called the
old frog, when she reached her home in the mud.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Croak! croak! croak!&rsquo; uttered the son, gazing with
pleasure at the sleeping child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush; don&rsquo;t make such a noise or you will wake
her!&rsquo; whispered the mother. &lsquo;I mean her to be a wife
for you, and while we are preparing for the wedding we
will set her on that water-lily leaf in the middle of the
brook, so that she may not be able to run away from
us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was on this green floating prison that Maia awoke,
frightened and puzzled, with the first rays of the sun.
She stood up straight on the leaf, looking about her for
a way of escape, and, finding none, she sat down again
and began to weep bitterly. At length her sobs were
heard by the old frog, who was busy in her house at the
bottom of the marsh, twisting rushes into a soft carpet
for Maia&rsquo;s feet, and twining reeds and grapes over the
doorway, to make it look pretty for the bride.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! the poor child feels lost and unhappy,&rsquo; she thought
pitifully, for her heart was kind. &lsquo;Well, I have just done,
and then my son and I will go to fetch her. When
she sees how handsome he is she will be all smiles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
again.&rsquo; And in a few minutes they both appeared beside
the leaf.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is your future husband. Did you ever see anyone
like him?&rsquo; asked the proud mother, pushing him forward.
But, after one glance, Maia only cried the more; and the
little fishes who lived in the stream came swimming round
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is absurd that such a pretty creature should be forced
to take a husband whom she does not want,&rsquo; said they
to each other. &lsquo;And such an ugly one too! However,
we can easily prevent it.&rsquo; And by turns they
gnawed the stem of the lily-leaf close to the root, till at
length it was free, and taking it in their mouths they bore
Maia far away, till the little stream grew into a great
river.</p>

<p>Oh, how Maia enjoyed that voyage, when once she
became quite certain that the frogs could no longer reach
her. Past many towns she went, and the people on the
banks all turned to look at her, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a lovely little girl! Where can she have come
from?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a lovely little girl!&rsquo; twittered the birds in the
bushes. And a blue butterfly fell in love with her, and
would not leave her; so she took off her sash, which just
matched him, and tied it round his body, so that with
this new kind of horse she travelled much faster than
before.</p>

<p>Unluckily, a great cockchafer, who was buzzing over
the river, happened to catch sight of her, and caught
her up in his claws. The poor butterfly was terribly
frightened at the sight of him, and he struggled hard to
free himself, so that the sash bow gave way, and he flew
off into the sunshine. But Maia wasn&rsquo;t so fortunate,
and though the cockchafer collected honey from the
flowers for her dinner, and told her several times how
pretty she was, she could not feel at ease with him.
The cockchafer noticed this, and summoned his sisters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
to play with her; but they only stared rudely, and
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where did you pick up that strange object? She is
very ugly to be sure, but one ought to pity her for she has
only two legs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, and no feelers,&rsquo; added another; &lsquo;and she is so
thin! Well, our brother has certainly very odd taste!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;">
<a name="maia_carried_off" id="maia_carried_off"></a>
<img src="images/ofb27.jpg" width="331" height="400"
alt="Maia carried off by the cockchafer" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed he has!&rsquo; echoed the others. And they repeated
it so loud and so often that, in the end, he believed it too,
and snatching her up from the tree where he had placed
her, set her down upon a daisy which grew near the
ground.</p>

<p>Here Maia stayed for the whole summer, and really
was not at all unhappy. She ventured to walk about by
herself, and wove herself a bed of some blades of grass,
and placed it under a clover leaf for shelter. The red
cups that grew in the moss held as much dew as she wanted,
and the cockchafer had taught her how to get honey.
But summer does not last for ever, and by-and-by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
flowers withered, and instead of dew there was snow and
ice. Maia did not know what to do, for her clothes were
worn to rags, and though she tried to roll herself up in a
dry leaf it broke under her fingers. It soon was plain to
her that if she did not get some other shelter she would die
of hunger and cold.</p>

<p>So, gathering up all her courage, she left the forest
and crossed the road into what had been, in the summer,
a beautiful field of waving corn, but was now only a
mass of hard stalks. She wandered on, seeing nothing
but the sky above her head, till she suddenly found
herself close to an opening which seemed to lead underground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will be warm, at any rate,&rsquo; thought Maia, &lsquo;and
perhaps the person who lives there will give me something
to eat. At any rate, I can&rsquo;t be worse off than I
am now.&rsquo; And she walked boldly down the passage.
By-and-by she came to a door which stood ajar, and,
peeping in, discovered a whole room full of corn. This
gave her heart, and she went on more swiftly, till she
reached a kitchen where an old field mouse was baking
a cake.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You poor little animal,&rsquo; cried the mouse, who had
never seen anything like her before, &lsquo;you look starved to
death! Come and sit here and get warm, and share my
dinner with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maia almost wept with joy at the old mouse&rsquo;s kind
words. She needed no second bidding, but ate more than
she had ever done in her life, though it was not a breakfast
for a humming-bird! When she had quite finished she
put out her hand and smiled, and the old mouse said to
her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can you tell stories? If so you may stay with me till
the sun gets hot again, and you shall help me with my
house. But it is dull here in the winter unless you have
somebody clever enough to amuse you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yes, Maia had learned a great many stories from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
foster-mother, and, besides, there were all her own adventures,
and her escapes from death. She knew also how
a room should be swept, and never failed to get up early
in the morning and have everything clean and tidy for the
old mouse.</p>

<p>So the winter passed away pleasantly, and Maia
began to talk of the spring, and of the time when she
would have to go out into the world again and seek her
fortune.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you need not begin to think of <em>that</em> for a while
yet,&rsquo; answered the field-mouse. &lsquo;Up on the earth they
have a proverb:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the day lengthens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the cold strengthens;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>it has been quite warm up to now, and the snow may fall
any time. Never a winter goes by without it, and <em>then</em>
you will be very thankful you are <em>here</em>, and not outside!
But I dare say it is quiet for a young thing like you,&rsquo; she
added, &lsquo;and I have invited my neighbour the mole to
come and pay us a visit. He has been asleep all these
months, but I hear he is waking up again. You would
be a lucky girl if he took into his head to marry you, only,
unfortunately, he is blind, and cannot see how pretty you
are.&rsquo; And for this blindness Maia felt truly glad, as she
did not want a mole for a husband.</p>

<p>However, by-and-by he paid his promised visit, and
Maia did not like him at all. He might be as rich and
learned as possible, but he hated the sun, and the trees,
and the flowers, and all that Maia loved best. To be
sure, being blind, he had never seen them, and, like many
other people, he thought that anything <em>he</em> did not know
was not worth knowing. But Maia&rsquo;s tales amused him,
though he would not for the world have let her see it, and
he admired her voice when she sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Mary, Mary, quite contrary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How does your garden grow?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hush-a-bye, baby, on the tree-top;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
though he told her that it was all nonsense, and that
trees and gardens were mere foolishness. When she
was <em>his</em> wife he would teach her things better worth
learning.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Meanwhile,&rsquo; he said, with a grand air, &lsquo;I have burrowed
a passage from this house to my own, in which you
can walk; but I warn you not to be frightened at a great
dead creature that has fallen through a hole in the roof,
and is lying on one side.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What sort of creature is it?&rsquo; asked Maia eagerly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I really can&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; answered the mole, indifferently;
&lsquo;it is covered with something soft, and it has
two thin legs, and a long sharp thing sticking out of its
head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a bird,&rsquo; cried Maia joyfully, &lsquo;and I love birds!
It must have died of cold,&rsquo; she added, dropping her voice.
&lsquo;Oh! good Mr. Mole, do take me to see it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come then, as I am going home,&rsquo; replied the mole.
And calling to the old field-mouse to accompany them,
they all set out.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; said the mole at last; &lsquo;dear me, how thankful
I am Fate did not make me a bird. They can&rsquo;t say anything
but &ldquo;twit, twit,&rdquo; and die with the first breath of
cold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes, poor useless creature,&rsquo; answered the field-mouse.
But while they were talking, Maia crept round to the other
side and stroked the feathers of the little swallow, and
kissed his eyes.</p>

<p>All that night she lay awake, thinking of the swallow
lying dead in the passage. At length she could bear it
no longer, and stole away to the place where the hay was
kept, and wove a thick carpet. Next she went to the
field-mouse&rsquo;s store of cotton which she picked in the summer
from some of the marsh flowers, and carrying them
both down the passage, she tucked the cotton underneath
the bird and spread the hay quilt over him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you were one of the swallows who sang to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
me in the summer,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I wish I could have brought
you to life again; but now, good-bye!&rsquo; And she laid her
face, wet with tears, on the breast of the bird. Surely she
felt a faint movement against her cheek? Yes, there it
was again! Suppose the bird was not dead after all, but
only senseless with cold and hunger! And at this thought
Maia hastened back to the house, and brought some grains
of corn, and a drop of water in a leaf. This she held close
to the swallow&rsquo;s beak, which he opened unconsciously,
and when he had sipped the water she gave him the grains
one by one.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Make no noise, so that no one may guess you are not
dead,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;To-night I will bring you some more
food, and I will tell the mole that he must stuff up the
hole again, as it makes the passage too cold for me to walk
in. And now farewell.&rsquo; And off she went, back to the
field-mouse, who was sound asleep.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>After some days of Maia&rsquo;s careful nursing, the swallow
felt strong enough to talk, and he told Maia how he came
to be in the place where she found him. Before he was
big enough to fly very high he had torn his wing in a rosebush,
so that he could not keep up with his family and
friends when they took their departure to warmer lands.
In their swift course they never noticed that their little
brother was not with them, and at last he dropped on the
ground from sheer fatigue, and must have rolled down the
hole into the passage.</p>

<p>It was very lucky for the swallow that both the mole
and the field-mouse thought he was dead, and did not
trouble about him, so that when the spring <em>really</em> came,
and the sun was hot, and blue hyacinths grew in the woods
and primroses in the hedges, he was as tall and strong as
any of his companions.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have saved my life, dear little Maia,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;but now the time has come for me to leave you&mdash;unless,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
he added, &lsquo;you will let me carry you on my back far away
from this gloomy prison.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maia&rsquo;s eyes sparkled at the thought, but she shook her
head bravely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, you must go; but I must stay behind,&rsquo; she answered.
&lsquo;The field-mouse has been good to me, and I cannot desert
her like that. Do you think you can open the hole for
yourself?&rsquo; she asked anxiously. &lsquo;If so, you had better
begin now, for this evening we are to have supper with the
mole, and it would never do for my foster-mother to find
you working at it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; answered the swallow. And flying up
to the roof,&mdash;which, after all, was not very high above
them&mdash;he set to work with his bill, and soon let a flood
of sunshine into the dark place.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Won&rsquo;t</em> you come with me, Maia?&rsquo; said he. And though
her heart longed for the trees and the flowers, she answered
as before:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I cannot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That one glimpse of the sun was all Maia had for
some time, for the corn sprung up so thickly over the
hole and about the house, that there might almost as
well have been no sun at all. However, though she
missed her bird friend every moment, she had no leisure
to be idle, for the field-mouse had told her that very
soon she was to be married to the mole, and kept her
spinning wool and cotton for her outfit. And as she had
never in her life made a dress, four clever spiders were
persuaded to spend the days underground, turning the
wool and cotton into tiny garments. Maia liked the
clothes, but hated the thought of the blind mole, only
she did not know how to escape him. In the evenings,
when the spiders were going to their homes for the night,
she would walk with them to the door and wait till a puff
of wind blew the corn ears apart, and she could see
the sky.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If the swallow would only come now,&rsquo; she said to herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
&lsquo;I would go with him to the end of the world.&rsquo; But he
never came!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your outfit is all finished,&rsquo; said the field-mouse one
day when the berries were red and the leaves yellow, &lsquo;and
the mole and I have decided that your wedding shall be
in four weeks&rsquo; time.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, not so soon! not so soon!&rsquo; cried Maia, bursting
into tears; which made the field-mouse very angry, and
declare that Maia had no more sense than other girls,
and did not know what was good for her. Then the mole
arrived, and carried her on his back to see the new house
he had dug for her, which was so very far under ground
that Maia&rsquo;s tiny legs could never bring her up even as
high as the field-mouse&rsquo;s dwelling, from which she might
see the sunlight. Her heart grew heavier and heavier as
the days went by, and in the last evening of all she crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
out into the field among the stubble, to watch the sun set
before she bade it good-bye for ever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Farewell, farewell,&rsquo; she said &lsquo;and farewell to my
little swallow. Ah! if he only knew, he would come to
help me.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">

title="He helped her to jump from the swallow&#39;s back" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Twit! twit,&rsquo; cried a voice just above her; and the
swallow fluttered to the ground beside her. &lsquo;You look
sad; are you <em>really</em> going to let that ugly mole marry
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall soon die, that is one comfort,&rsquo; she answered
weeping. But the swallow only said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tut! tut! get on my back, as I told you before, and
I will take you to a land where the sun always shines,
and you will soon forget that such a creature as a mole
ever existed.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
&lsquo;Yes, I will come,&rsquo; said Maia.</p>

<p>Then the swallow tore off one of the corn stalks with
his strong beak, and bade her tie it safely to his wing.
And they started off, flying, flying south for many a day.</p>

<p>Oh! how happy Maia was to see the beautiful earth
again! A hundred times she longed for the swallow to
stop, but he always told her that the best was yet to be;
and they flew on and on, only halting for short rests, till
they reached a place covered with tall white marble
pillars, some standing high, wreathed in vines, out of
which endless swallows&rsquo; heads were peeping; others
lying stretched among the flowers, white, yellow, and blue.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I live up there,&rsquo; said the swallow, pointing to the tallest
of the pillars. &lsquo;But such a house would never do for you,
as you would only fall out of it and kill yourself. So
choose one of those flowers below, and you shall have it
for your own, and sleep all night curled up in its leaves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will have that one,&rsquo; answered Maia, pointing to a
white flower shaped like a star, with a tiny crinkled wreath
of red and yellow in its centre, and a long stem that swayed
in the wind; &lsquo;that one is the prettiest of all, and it smells
so sweet.&rsquo; Then the swallow flew down towards it; but as
they drew near they saw a tiny little manikin with a crown
on his head, and wings on his shoulders, balancing himself
on one of the leaves. &lsquo;Ah, that is the king of the flower-spirits,&rsquo;
whispered the swallow. And the king stretched
out his hands to Maia, and helped her to jump from the
swallow&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have waited for you for a long while,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
now you have come at last to be my queen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Maia smiled, and stood beside him as all the fairies
that dwelt in the flowers ran to fetch presents for her; and
the best of them all was a pair of lovely gauzy blue wings
to help fly about like one of themselves.</p>

<p>So instead of marrying the mole, Little Maia was crowned
a queen, and the fairies danced round her in a ring, while
the swallow sang the wedding song.</p>

<h2><i>DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND</i></h2>


<p>In a village in Hindustan there once lived a merchant
who, although he rose early, worked hard, and rested late,
remained very poor; and ill-luck so dogged him that he
determined at last to go to some distant country and
there to try his fortune. Twelve years passed by; his
luck had turned, and now he had gathered great wealth,
so that having plenty to keep him in comfort for the
rest of his days, he thought once more of his native
village, where he desired to spend the remainder of his
life among his own people. In order to carry his riches
with him in safety over the many weary miles that lay
between him and his home, he bought some magnificent
jewels, which he locked up in a little box and wore concealed
upon his person; and, so as not to draw the
attention of the thieves who infested the highways and
made their living by robbing travellers, he started off in
the poor clothes of a man who has nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, he travelled quickly, and within a few
days&rsquo; journey from his own village came to a city where he
determined to buy better garments and&mdash;now that he was
no longer afraid of thieves&mdash;to look more like the rich
man he had become. In his new raiment he approached
the city, and near the great gate he found a bazaar where,
amongst many shops filled with costly silks, and carpets,
and goods of all countries, was one finer than all the rest.
There, amidst his goods, spread out to the best advantage,
sat the owner smoking a long silver pipe, and thither the
merchant bent his steps, and saluting the owner politely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
sat down also and began to make some purchases. Now,
the proprietor of the shop, Beeka Mull by name, was a
very shrewd man, and as he and the merchant conversed,
he soon felt sure that his customer was richer than he
seemed, and was trying to conceal the fact. Certain purchases
having been made, he invited the new-comer to
refresh himself and in a short time they were chatting
pleasantly together. In the course of the conversation
Beeka Mull asked the merchant whither he was travelling,
and hearing the name of the village, he observed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, you had better be careful on that road&mdash;it&rsquo;s a very
bad place for thieves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The merchant turned pale at these words. It would
be such a bitter thing, he thought, just at the end of his
journey to be robbed of all the fortune he had heaped up
with such care. But this bland and prosperous Beeka
Mull must surely know best, so presently he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lala-ji,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> could you oblige me by locking up for me a
small box for a short while? When once I get to my
village I could bring back half-a-dozen sturdy men of
my own kinsfolk and claim it again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Lala shook his head. &lsquo;I could not do it,&rsquo; replied
he. &lsquo;I am sorry; but such things are not my business.
I should be afraid to undertake it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; pleaded the merchant, &lsquo;I know no one in this
city, and you must surely have some place where you keep
your own precious things. Do this, I pray you, as a great
favour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still Beeka Mull politely but firmly refused; but the
merchant, feeling that he had now betrayed the fact that
he was richer than he seemed, and being loth to make
more people aware of it by inquiring elsewhere, continued
to press him, until at last he consented. The merchant
produced the little box of jewels, and Beeka Mull locked
it up for him in a strong chest with other precious stones;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
and so, with many promises and compliments, they
parted.</p>

<p>In a place like an Eastern bazaar, where the shops lie
with wide open fronts, and with their goods displayed
not only within but without on terraces and verandahs
raised a few feet above the public roadway, such a long
talk as that between Beeka Mull and the merchant could
not but attract some attention from the other shop-keepers
in the narrow street. If the merchant had but known it,
nearly every shop-owner in that district was a thief, and
the cleverest and biggest of all was Beeka Mull. But he
did not know it, only he could not help feeling a little
uneasy at having thus parted with all his wealth to a stranger.
And so, as he wandered down the street, making a purchase
here and there, he managed in one way and another to
ask some questions about the honesty of Beeka Mull, and
each rascal whom he spoke to, knowing that there was
some good reason in the question, and hoping to get in
return some share of the spoils, replied in praise of Beeka
Mull as a model of all the virtues.</p>

<p>In this way the merchant&rsquo;s fears were stilled, and,
with a comparatively light heart, he travelled on to his
village; and within a week or so returned to the city with
half-a-dozen sturdy young nephews and friends whom
he had enlisted to help him carry home his precious
box.</p>

<p>At the great market-place in the centre of the city the
merchant left his friends, saying that he would go and
get the box of jewels and rejoin them, to which they consented,
and away he went. Arrived at the shop of Beeka
Mull, he went up and saluted him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-day, Lala-ji,&rsquo; said he. But the Lala pretended
not to see him. So he repeated the salutation. &lsquo;What
do you want?&rsquo; snapped Beeka Mull; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve said your
&ldquo;good-day&rdquo; twice, why don&rsquo;t you tell me your business?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me?&rsquo; asked the merchant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
&lsquo;Remember you?&rsquo; growled the other; &lsquo;no, why should
I? I have plenty to do to remember good customers
without trying to remember every beggar who comes
whining for charity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When he heard this the merchant began to tremble.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lala-ji!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;surely you remember me and the
little box I gave you to take care of? And you promised&mdash;yes,
indeed, you promised very kindly&mdash;that I might
return to claim it, and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You scoundrel,&rsquo; roared Beeka Mull, &lsquo;get out of my
shop! Be off with you, you impudent scamp! Every
one knows that I never keep treasures for anyone; I have
trouble enough to do to keep my own! Come, off with
you!&rsquo; With that he began to push the merchant out
of the shop; and, when the poor man resisted, two of
the bystanders came to Beeka Mull&rsquo;s help, and flung the
merchant out into the road, like a bale of goods dropped
from a camel. Slowly he picked himself up out of the
dust, bruised, battered, and bleeding, but feeling nothing
of the pain in his body, nothing but a dreadful numbing
sensation that, after all, he was ruined and lost! Slowly
he dragged himself a little further from where the fat and
furious Beeka Mull still stood amongst his disordered
silks and carpets, and coming to a friendly wall he
crouched and leant against it, and putting his head into
his hands gave himself up to an agony of misery and
despair.</p>

<p>There he sat motionless, like one turned to stone, whilst
darkness fell around him; and when, about eleven o&rsquo;clock
that night, a certain gay young fellow named Kooshy
Ram passed by with a friend, he saw the merchant sitting
hunched against the wall, and remarked: &lsquo;A thief, no
doubt.&rsquo; &lsquo;You are wrong,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;thieves
don&rsquo;t sit in full view of people like that, even at night.&rsquo;
And so the two passed on, and thought no more of him.
About five o&rsquo;clock next morning Kooshy Ram was returning
home again, when, to his astonishment, he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
the miserable merchant still sitting as he had seen him
sit hours before. Surely something must be the matter
with a man who sat all night in the open street, and Kooshy
Ram resolved to see what it was; so he went up and shook
the merchant gently by the shoulder. &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
asked he&mdash;&lsquo;and what are you doing here&mdash;are you
ill?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ill?&rsquo; said the merchant in a hollow voice, &lsquo;yes; ill with
a sickness for which there is no medicine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, nonsense!&rsquo; cried Kooshy Ram. &lsquo;Come along with
me, I know a medicine that will cure you, I think.&rsquo; So
the young man seized the merchant by the arm, and
hoisting him to his feet, dragged him to his own lodging;
where he first of all gave him a large glass of wine, and
then, after he had refreshed him with food, bade him tell
his adventures.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Meanwhile the merchant&rsquo;s companions in the market-place,
being dull-witted persons, thought that as he did
not return he must have gone home by himself; and as
soon as they were tired of waiting they went back to their
village and left him to look after his own affairs. He
would therefore have fared badly had it not been for his
rescuer, Kooshy Ram, who, whilst still a boy, had been left
a great deal of money with no one to advise him how to
spend it. He was high-spirited, kind-hearted, and shrewd
into the bargain; but he threw away his money like water,
and generally upon the nearest thing or person in his way,
and that, alas! most often was himself! Now, however,
he had taken it into his head to befriend this miserable
merchant, and he meant to do it; and on his side the merchant
felt confidence revive, and without further ado told
all that had happened.</p>

<p>Kooshy Ram laughed heartily at the idea of any stranger
entrusting his wealth to Beeka Mull.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, he is the greatest rascal in the city,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;unless you believe what some of them say of me! Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
there is nothing to be done for the present, but just to
stay here quietly, and I think that at the end of a short
time I shall find a medicine which will heal your sickness.&rsquo;
At this the merchant again took courage, and a little ease
crept into his heart as he gratefully accepted his new friend&rsquo;s
invitation.</p>

<p>A few days later Kooshy Ram sent for some friends
to see him, and talked with them long, and, although the
merchant did not hear the conversation, he did hear shouts
of laughter as though at some good joke; but the laughter
echoed dully in his own heart, for the more he considered
the more he despaired of ever recovering his fortune from
the grasp of Beeka Mull.</p>

<p>One day, soon after this, Kooshy Ram came to him
and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You remember the wall where I found you that night,
near Beeka Mull&rsquo;s shop?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed I do,&rsquo; answered the merchant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued Kooshy Ram, &lsquo;this afternoon you
must go and stand in that same spot and watch; and when
someone gives you a signal, you must go up to Beeka
Mull and salute him and say, &ldquo;Oh, Lala-ji, will you kindly
let me have back that box of mine which you have on
trust?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of that?&rsquo; asked the merchant. &lsquo;He
won&rsquo;t do it any more now than he would when I asked
him before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind!&rsquo; replied Kooshy Ram, &lsquo;do exactly what
I tell you, and repeat exactly what I say, word for word,
and I will answer for the rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, that afternoon, the merchant at a certain time went
and stood by the wall as he was told. He noticed that
Beeka Mull saw him, but neither took any heed of the
other. Presently up the bazaar came a gorgeous palanquin
like those in which ladies of rank are carried about. It
was borne by four bearers well dressed in rich liveries,
and its curtains and trappings were truly magnificent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
In attendance was a grave-looking personage whom the
merchant recognized as one of the friends who visited
Kooshy Ram; and behind him came a servant with a box
covered with a cloth upon his head.</p>

<p>The palanquin was borne along at a smart pace and
was set down at Beeka Mull&rsquo;s shop. The fat shop-keeper
was on his feet at once, and bowed deeply as the gentleman
in attendance advanced.</p>

<p>&lsquo;May I inquire,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;who this is in the palanquin
that deigns to favour my humble shop with a visit? And
what may I do for her?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman, after whispering at the curtain of the
palanquin, explained that this was a relative of his who
was travelling, but as her husband could go no further
with her, she desired to leave with Beeka Mull a box of
jewels for safe custody. Lala bowed again to the ground.
&lsquo;It was not,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;quite in his way of business; but of
course, if he could please the lady, he would be most happy,
and would guard the box with his life.&rsquo; Then the servant
carrying the box was called up; the box was unlocked,
and a mass of jewellery laid open to the gaze of the enraptured
Lala, whose mouth watered as he turned over
the rich gems.</p>

<p>All this the merchant had watched from the distance,
and now he saw&mdash;could he be mistaken?&mdash;no, he distinctly
saw a hand beckoning through the curtain on
that side of the palanquin away from the shop. &lsquo;The
signal! Was this the signal?&rsquo; thought he. The hand
beckoned again, impatiently it seemed to him. So forward
he went, very quietly, and saluting Beeka Mull, who
was sitting turning over the contents of this amazing box
of jewels which fortune and some fools were putting into
his care, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lala-ji, will you kindly let me have back that
box of mine which you have on trust?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Lala looked up as though he had been stung; but
quickly the thought flashed through his mind that if this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
man began making a fuss again he would lose the confidence
of these new and richer customers; so he controlled himself,
and answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear me, of course, yes! I had forgotten all about it.&rsquo;
And he went off and brought the little box and put it into
the merchant&rsquo;s trembling hands. Quickly the latter pulled
out the key, which hung by a string round his neck, and
opened the box; and when he saw that his treasures were
all there he rushed into the road, and, with the box under
his arm, began dancing like a madman, with great shouts
and screams of laughter. Just then a messenger came
running up and, saluting the gentleman attending the
palanquin, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The lady&rsquo;s husband has returned, and is prepared to
travel with her, so that there is no necessity to deposit the
jewels.&rsquo; Whereat the gentleman quickly closed and relocked
the box, and handed it back to the waiting servant.
Then from the palanquin came a yell of laughter, and
out jumped&mdash;not a lady&mdash;but Kooshy Ram, who immediately
ran and joined the merchant in the middle of
the road and danced as madly as he. Beeka Mull stood
and stared stupidly at them; then, with a shrill cackle of
laughter, he flung off his turban, bounced out into the
road with the other two, and fell to dancing and snapping
his fingers until he was out of breath.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lala-ji,&rsquo; said the gentleman who had played the
part of the relative attendant on the palanquin, &lsquo;why do
you dance? The merchant dances because he has
recovered his fortune; Kooshy Ram dances because he
is a madman and has tricked you; but why do <em>you</em>
dance?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dance,&rsquo; panted Beeka Ram, glaring at him with a
bloodshot eye, &lsquo;I dance because I knew thirteen different
ways of deceiving people by pretending confidence in
them. I didn&rsquo;t know there were any more, and now
here&rsquo;s a fourteenth! That&rsquo;s why I dance!&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>THE GREEN KNIGHT</i></h2>


<p>There lived once a king and queen who had an only
daughter, a charming and beautiful girl, dearer to them
than anything else in the world. When the princess was
twelve years old the queen fell sick, and nothing that could
be done for her was of any use. All the doctors in the
kingdom did their best to cure her, but in spite of their
efforts she grew worse and worse. As she was about to
die, she sent for the king and said to him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Promise me that whatever our daughter asks, you will
do, no matter whether you wish to or not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king at first hesitated, but as she added:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Unless you promise this I cannot die in peace,&rsquo; he at
length did as she desired, and gave the promise, after
which she became quite happy and died.</p>

<p>It happened that near the king&rsquo;s palace lived a noble
lady, whose little girl was of about the same age as the
princess, and the two children were always together. After
the queen&rsquo;s death the princess begged that this lady should
come to live with her in the palace. The king was not
quite pleased with this arrangement, for he distrusted the
lady; but the princess wished so much for it that he did
not like to refuse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am lonely, father,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and all the beautiful
presents you give me cannot make up to me for the loss
of my mother. If this lady comes to live here I shall
almost feel as if the queen had come back to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So a magnificent suite of rooms was prepared and set
aside for the new-comers, and the little princess was wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
with joy at the thought of having her friends so near her.
The lady and her daughter arrived, and for a long time
all went well. They were very kind to the motherless
princess, and she almost began to forget how dull she had
been before they came. Then, one day, as she and the
other girl were playing together in the gardens of the palace,
the lady came to them, dressed for a journey, and kissed
the princess tenderly, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Farewell, my child; my daughter and I must leave you
and go far away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor princess began to cry bitterly. &lsquo;Oh! you must
not leave me!&rsquo; she sobbed. &lsquo;What shall I do without
you? Please, oh! please stay.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The lady shook her head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It almost breaks my heart to go, dear child,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;but, alas! it must be.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is there nothing that can keep you here?&rsquo; asked the
princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only one thing,&rsquo; answered the lady, &lsquo;and as that is
impossible, we will not speak of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing is impossible,&rsquo; persisted the princess. &lsquo;Tell
me what it is, and it shall be done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So at last her friend told her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If the king, your father, would make me his queen
I would stay,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but that he would never do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes! <em>that</em> is easy enough!&rsquo; cried the princess, delighted
to think that, after all, they need not be parted.
And she ran off to find her father, and beg him to marry
the lady at once. He had done everything she asked, and
she was quite certain he would do it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it, my daughter?&rsquo; he asked, when he saw her.
&lsquo;You have been crying&mdash;are you not happy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I have come to ask you to marry
the countess&rsquo;&mdash;(for that was the lady&rsquo;s real title)&mdash;&lsquo;if
you do not she will leave us, and then I shall be as lonely
as before. You have never refused me what I have asked
before, do not refuse me now.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
The king turned quite pale when he heard this. He
did not like the countess, and so, of course, he did not
wish to marry her; besides, he still loved his dead wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, that I cannot do, my child,&rsquo; he said at last.</p>

<p>At these words the princess began to cry once more,
and the tears ran down her cheeks so fast, and she sobbed
so bitterly, that her father felt quite miserable too. He
remembered the promise he had given always to do what
his daughter asked him and in the end he gave way, and
promised to marry the countess. The princess at once
was all smiles, and ran away to tell the good news.</p>

<p>Soon after, the wedding was celebrated with great festivities,
and the countess became queen; but, in spite
of all the joy and merriment that filled the palace, the
king looked pale and sad, for he was certain that ill would
come of the marriage. Sure enough, in a very short time
the queen&rsquo;s manner towards the princess began to change.
She was jealous of her because she, instead of her own
daughter, was heir to the throne, and very soon she could
no longer hide her thoughts. Instead of speaking kindly
and lovingly as before, her words became rough and
cruel, and once or twice she even slapped the princess&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>The king was very unhappy at seeing his dearly loved
daughter suffer, and at last she became so wretched that
he could no longer bear it. Calling her to him one day
he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My daughter, you are no longer merry as you should
be, and I fear that it is the fault of your step-mother. It
will be better for you to live with her no longer; therefore
I have built you a castle on the island in the lake, and
that is to be your home in future. There you can do just
as you like, and your step-mother will never enter it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess was delighted to hear this, and still more
pleased when she saw the castle, which was full of beautiful
things, and had a great number of windows looking
out on the lovely blue water. There was a boat in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
she might row herself about, and a garden where she
could walk whenever she wished without fear of meeting
the unkind queen; and the king promised to visit her
every day.</p>

<p>For a long time she dwelt in peace, and grew more and
more beautiful every day. Everyone who saw her said
&lsquo;The princess is the loveliest lady in the land.&rsquo; And this
was told to the queen, who hated her step-daughter still
more because her own daughter was ugly and stupid.</p>

<p>One day it was announced that a great meeting of knights
and nobles was to be held in a neighbouring kingdom
distant about two days&rsquo; journey. There were to be all
kinds of festivities, and a tournament was to be fought
and a banquet held, in honour of the coming of age of
the prince of the country.</p>

<p>The princess&rsquo;s father was amongst those invited, but
before he set out he went to take leave of his daughter.
Although she had such a beautiful home, and was no
longer scolded by the queen, the poor princess was dreadfully
lonely, and she told her father that it would be better
if she were dead. He did his best to comfort her and
promised that he would soon return. Was there anything
he could do to help her?</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You may greet the Green Knight
from me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the king wondered a little at these words, for he
had never heard of the Green Knight; but there was no
time to ask questions, therefore he gave the promise, and
rode off on his journey. When he came to the palace
where the festivities were to take place, the first thing he
did was to ask:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can anyone tell me where I may find the Green
Knight?&rsquo;</p>

<p>No, they were very sorry; but none had ever heard of
such a person either&mdash;certainly he was not to be found
there. At this the king grew troubled, and not even the
banquet or the tournament could make him feel happier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
He inquired of everyone he saw, &lsquo;Do you know the Green
Knight?&rsquo; but the only answer he got was:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, your majesty, we have never heard of him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At length he began to believe that the princess was
mistaken, and that there was no such person; and he
started on his homeward journey sorrowfully enough, for
this was the first time for many months that the princess
had asked him to do anything for her and he could not
do it. He thought so much about it that he did not notice
the direction his horse was taking, and presently he found
himself in the midst of a dense forest where he had never
been before. He rode on and on, looking for the path,
but as the sun began to set he realised that he was lost.
At last, to his delight, he saw a man driving some pigs,
and riding up to him, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have lost my way. Can you tell me where I am?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are in the Green Knight&rsquo;s forest,&rsquo; answered the
man, &lsquo;and these are his pigs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At that the king&rsquo;s heart grew light. &lsquo;Where does the
Green Knight live?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a very long way from here,&rsquo; said the swineherd;
&lsquo;but I will show you the path.&rsquo; So he went a little farther
with the king and put him on the right road, and the king
bade him farewell.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a second forest, and there he met
another swineherd driving pigs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whose beasts are those, my man?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are the Green Knight&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And where does he live?&rsquo; inquired the king.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, not far from here,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>Then the king rode on, and about midday he reached
a beautiful castle standing in the midst of the loveliest
garden you can possibly imagine, where fountains played
in marble basins, and peacocks walked on the smooth
lawns. On the edge of a marble basin sat a young and
handsome man, who was dressed from head to foot in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
suit of green armour, and was feeding the goldfish which
swam in the clear water.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This must be the Green Knight,&rsquo; thought the king;
and going up to the young man he said courteously:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have come, sir, to give you my daughter&rsquo;s greeting.
But I have wandered far, and lost my way in your forest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The knight looked at him for a moment as though
puzzled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have never met either you or your daughter,&rsquo; he said
at last; &lsquo;but you are very welcome all the same.&rsquo; And
he waved his hand towards the castle. However, the
king took no notice, and told him that his daughter had
sent a message to the Green Knight, and as he was the
only Green Knight in the kingdom this message must be
for him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must pass the night with me here,&rsquo; said the knight;
and as the sun was already set, the king was thankful to
accept the invitation. They sat down in the castle hall
to a magnificent banquet, and although he had travelled
much and visited many monarchs in their palaces, the
king had never fared better than at the table of the Green
Knight, whilst his host himself was so clever and agreeable,
that he was delighted, and thought &lsquo;what a charming
son-in-law this knight would make!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next morning, when he was about to set forth on his
journey home, the Green Knight put into his hand a jewelled
casket, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will your highness graciously condescend to carry this
gift to the princess, your daughter? It contains my portrait,
that when I come she may know me; for I feel certain
that she is the lady I have seen night after night in a dream,
and I must win her for my bride.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king gave the knight his blessing, and promised to
take the gift to his daughter. With that he set off, and
ere long reached his own country.</p>

<p>The princess was awaiting him anxiously when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
arrived, and ran to his arms in her joy at seeing her dear
father again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And did you see the Green Knight?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered the king, drawing out the casket the
knight had sent, &lsquo;and he begged me to give you this that
you may know him when he arrives and not mistake him
for somebody else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the princess saw the portrait she was delighted,
and exclaimed: &lsquo;It is indeed the man whom I have seen
in my dreams! Now I shall be happy, for he and no
other shall be my husband.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Very soon after the Green Knight arrived, and he
looked so handsome in his green armour, with a long
green plume in his helmet, that the princess fell still
more in love with him than before, and when he saw
her, and recognised her as the lady whom he had so
often dreamt of, he immediately asked her to be his bride.
The princess looked down and smiled as she answered
him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;We must keep the secret from my step-mother until
the wedding-day,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;for otherwise she will find a
way to do us some evil.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; replied the prince; &lsquo;but I must visit
you daily, for I can live no longer without you! I will
come early in the morning and not leave until it is dark;
thus the queen will not see me row across the lake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For a long time, the Green Knight visited the princess
every day, and spent many hours wandering with her
through the beautiful gardens where they knew the queen
could not see them. But secrets, as you know, are dangerous
things, and at last, one morning, a girl who was in
service at the palace happened to be walking by the lake
early in the morning and beheld a wonderfully handsome
young man, in a beautiful suit of green satin, come down
to the edge of the lake. Not guessing that he was watched,
he got into a little boat that lay moored to the bank,
rowed himself over to the island where the princess&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
castle stood. The girl went home wondering who the
knight could be; and as she was brushing the queen&rsquo;s
hair, she said to her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does your majesty know that the princess has a
suitor?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px;">
<a name="poisoned_nail" id="poisoned_nail"></a>
<img src="images/ofb30.jpg" width="466" height="500"
alt="The queen puts a poisoned nail into the oar"
title="The poisoned nail" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; replied the queen crossly. But she was
dreadfully vexed at the mere idea, as her own daughter
was still unmarried, and was likely to remain so, because
she was so ill-tempered and stupid that no one wanted
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; persisted the girl. &lsquo;He is dressed all in
green, and is very handsome. I saw him myself, though
he did not see me, and he got into a boat and rowed over
to the island, and the princess was waiting for him at the
castle door.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must find out what this means,&rsquo; thought the queen.
But she bade her maid of honour cease chattering and
mind her own business.</p>

<p>Early next morning the queen got up and went down
to the shore of the lake, where she hid herself behind a
tree. Sure enough there came a handsome knight dressed
in green, just as the maid of honour had said, and he
got into a boat and rowed over to the island where
the princess awaited him. The angry queen remained
by the lake all day, but it was not until the evening
that the knight returned, and leaping on shore, he
tied the boat to its moorings and went away through the
forest.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>&lsquo;I have caught my step-daughter nicely,&rsquo; thought the
queen. &lsquo;But she shall not be married before my own
sweet girl. I must find a way to put a stop to this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly she took a poisoned nail and stuck it in
the handle of the oar in such a way that the knight would
be sure to scratch his hand when he picked up the oar.
Then she went home laughing, very much pleased with
her cleverness.</p>

<p>The next day the Green Knight went to visit the princess
as usual; but directly he took up the oars to row over to
the island he felt a sharp scratch on his hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oof!&rsquo; he said, dropping the oars from pain, &lsquo;what can
have scratched so?&rsquo; But, look as he might, only a tiny
mark was to be seen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s strange how a nail could have come here
since yesterday,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Still, it is not very serious,
though it hurts a good deal.&rsquo; And, indeed, it seemed
such a little thing that he did not mention it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
princess. However, when he reached home in the evening,
he felt so ill he was obliged to go to bed, with no
one to attend on him except his old nurse. But of this,
of course, the princess knew nothing; and the poor
girl, fearing lest some evil should have befallen him,
or some other maiden more beautiful than she should
have stolen his heart from her, grew almost sick with
waiting. Lonely, indeed, she was, for her father, who
would have helped her, was travelling in a foreign country,
and she knew not how to obtain news of her lover.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>In this manner time passed away, and one day, as she
sat by the open window crying and feeling very sad, a
little bird came and perched on the branch of a tree that
stood just underneath. It began to sing, and so beautifully
that the princess was obliged to stop crying and listen to it,
and very soon she found out that the bird was trying to
attract her attention.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Tu-whit, tu-whit!</em> your lover is sick!&rsquo; it sang.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; cried the princess. &lsquo;What can I do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Tu-whit, tu-whit!</em> you must go to your father&rsquo;s
palace!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what shall I do there?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Tu-whit!</em> there you will find a snake with nine young
ones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; answered the princess with a shiver, for she did
not like snakes. But the little bird paid no heed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Put them in a basket and go to the Green Knight&rsquo;s
palace,&rsquo; said she.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what am I to do with them when I get there?&rsquo;
she cried, blushing all over, though there was no one to
see her but the bird.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dress yourself as a kitchen-maid and ask for a place.
<em>Tu-whit!</em> Then you must make soup out of the snakes.
Give it three times to the knight and he will be cured.
<em>Tu-whit!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
&lsquo;But what has made him ill?&rsquo; asked the princess. The
bird, however, had flown away, and there was nothing
for it but to go to her father&rsquo;s palace and look for the
snakes. When she came there she found the mother
snake with the nine little snakes all curled up so that you
could hardly tell their heads from their tails. The princess
did not like having to touch them, but when the old snake
had wriggled out of the nest to bask a little in the sun,
she picked up the young ones and put them in a basket
as the bird had told her, and ran off to find the Green
Knight&rsquo;s castle. All day she walked along, sometimes
stopping to pick the wild berries, or to gather a nosegay;
but though she rested now and then, she would not lie
down to sleep before she reached the castle. At last she
came in sight of it, and just then she met a girl driving a
flock of geese.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-day!&rsquo; said the princess; &lsquo;can you tell me if this
is the castle of the Green Knight?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, that it is,&rsquo; answered the goose girl, &lsquo;for I am driving
his geese. But the Green Knight is very ill, and they say
that unless he can be cured within three days he will surely
die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this news the princess grew as white as death. The
ground seemed to spin round, and she closed her hand
tight on a bush that was standing beside her. By-and-by,
with a great effort, she recovered herself and said to the
goose girl:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Would you like to have a fine silk dress to wear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The goose girl&rsquo;s eyes glistened.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, that I would!&rsquo; answered she.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then take off your dress and give it to me, and I will
give you mine,&rsquo; said the princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/ofb31.jpg" width="383" height="600"
alt="The princess changes clothes with the goose-girl" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>The girl could scarcely believe her ears, but the princess
was already unfastening her beautiful silk dress, and
taking off her silk stockings and pretty red shoes; and the
goose girl lost no time in slipping out of her rough linen
skirt and tunic. Then the princess put on the other&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
rags and let down her hair, and went to the kitchen to ask
for a place.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you want a kitchen-maid?&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, we do,&rsquo; answered the cook, who was too busy to
ask the new-comer many questions.</p>

<p>The following day, after a good night&rsquo;s rest, the princess
set about her new duties. The other servants were speaking
of their master, and saying to each other how ill he
was, and that unless he could be cured within three days
he would surely die.</p>

<p>The princess thought of the snakes, and the bird&rsquo;s advice,
and lifting her head from the pots and pans she was scouring,
she said: &lsquo;I know how to make a soup that has such a
wonderful power that whoever tastes it is sure to be cured,
whatever his illness may be. As the doctors cannot cure
your master shall I try?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At first they all laughed at her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What! a scullion cure the knight when the best physicians
in the kingdom have failed?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But at last, just because all the physicians <em>had</em> failed,
they decided that it would do no harm to try; and she ran
off joyfully to fetch her basket of snakes and make them
into broth. When this was ready she carried some to the
knight&rsquo;s room and entered it boldly, pushing aside all the
learned doctors who stood beside his bed. The poor
knight was too ill to know her, besides, she was so ragged
and dirty that he would not have been likely to do so had
he been well; but when he had taken the soup he was so
much better that he was able to sit up.</p>

<p>The next day he had some more, and then he was able
to dress himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is certainly wonderful soup!&rsquo; said the cook.</p>

<p>The third day, after he had eaten his soup, the knight
was quite well again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he asked the girl; &lsquo;was it you who made
this soup that has cured me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered the princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
&lsquo;Choose, then, whatever you wish as a reward,&rsquo; said
the knight, &lsquo;and you shall have it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would be your bride!&rsquo; said the princess.</p>

<p>The knight frowned in surprise at such boldness, and
shook his head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is the one thing I cannot grant,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for I
am pledged to marry the most beautiful princess in the
world. Choose again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the princess ran away and washed herself and
mended her rags, and when she returned the Green Knight
recognised her at once.</p>

<p>You can think what a joyful meeting that was!</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Soon after, they were married with great splendour.
All the knights and princes in the kingdom were summoned
to the wedding, and the princess wore a dress that
shone like the sun, so that no one had ever beheld a more
gorgeous sight. The princess&rsquo;s father, of course, was
present, but the wicked queen and her daughter were
driven out of the country, and as nobody has seen them
since, very likely they were eaten by wild beasts in the
forest. But the bride and bridegroom were so happy that
they forgot all about them, and they lived with the old
king till he died, when they succeeded him.</p>

<h2><i>THE FIVE WISE WORDS OF THE GURU</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h2>


<p>Once there lived a handsome young man named Ram
Singh, who, though a favourite with everyone, was unhappy
because he had a scold for a step-mother. All
day long she went on talking, until the youth was driven
so distracted that he determined to go away somewhere
and seek his fortune. No sooner had he decided to leave
his home than he made his plans, and the very next morning
he started off with a few clothes in a wallet, and a little
money in his pocket.</p>

<p>But there was one person in the village to whom he
wished to say good-bye, and that was a wise old guru, or
teacher, who had taught him much. So he turned his
face first of all towards his master&rsquo;s hut, and before the
sun was well up was knocking at his door. The old
man received his pupil affectionately; but he was wise
in reading faces, and saw at once that the youth was in
trouble.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what is the matter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing, father,&rsquo; replied the young man, &lsquo;but I have
determined to go into the world and seek my fortune.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Be advised,&rsquo; returned the guru, &lsquo;and remain in your
father&rsquo;s house; it is better to have half a loaf at home than
to seek a whole one in distant countries.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Ram Singh was in no mood to heed such advice,
and very soon the old man ceased to press him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he at last, &lsquo;if your mind is made up I suppose
you must have your way. But listen carefully, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
remember five parting counsels which I will give you;
and if you keep these no evil shall befall you. First&mdash;always
obey without question the orders of him whose
service you enter; second&mdash;never speak harshly or unkindly
to anyone; third&mdash;never lie; fourth&mdash;never try
to appear the equal of those above you in station; and
fifth&mdash;wherever you go, if you meet those who read
or teach from the holy books, stay and listen, if but for a
few minutes, that you may be strengthened in the path
of duty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Ram Singh started out upon his journey, promising
to bear in mind the old man&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>After some days he came to a great city. He had spent
all the money which he had at starting, and therefore
resolved to look for work however humble it might be.
Catching sight of a prosperous-looking merchant standing
in front of a shop full of grain of all kinds, Ram Singh
went up to him and asked whether he could give him
anything to do. The merchant gazed at him so long
that the young man began to lose heart, but at length he
answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course; there is a place waiting for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Ram Singh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied the other, &lsquo;yesterday our rajah&rsquo;s chief
wazir dismissed his body servant and is wanting another.
Now you are just the sort of person that he needs, for you
are young and tall, and handsome; I advise you to apply
there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thanking the merchant for this advice, the young man
set out at once for the wazir&rsquo;s house, and soon managed,
thanks to his good looks and appearance, to be engaged
as the great man&rsquo;s servant.</p>

<p>One day, soon after this, the rajah of the place started
on a journey and the chief wazir accompanied him. With
them was an army of servants and attendants, soldiers,
muleteers, camel-drivers, merchants with grain and stores
for man and beast, singers to make entertainment by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
the way and musicians to accompany them, besides elephants,
camels, horses, mules, ponies, donkeys, goats, and
carts and wagons of every kind and description, so that it
seemed more like a large town on the march than anything
else.</p>

<p>Thus they travelled for several days, till they entered
a country that was like a sea of sand, where the swirling
dust floated in clouds, and men and beasts were half
choked by it. Towards the close of that day they came
to a village, and when the headmen hurried out to salute
the rajah and to pay him their respects, they began, with
very long and serious faces, to explain that, whilst they
and all that they had were of course at the disposal of
the rajah, the coming of so large a company had nevertheless
put them into a dreadful difficulty because they
had never a well nor spring of water in their country; and
they had no water to give drink to such an army of men
and beasts!</p>

<p>Great fear fell upon the host at the words of the headmen,
but the rajah merely told the wazir that he must
get water somehow, and that settled the matter so far as
<em>he</em> was concerned. The wazir sent off in haste for all
the oldest men in the place, and began to question them
as to whether there were no wells near by.</p>

<p>They all looked helplessly at each other, and said nothing;
but at length one old grey-beard replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Truly, Sir Wazir, there is, within a mile or two of this
village, a well which some former king made hundreds of
years ago. It is, they say, great and inexhaustible, covered
in by heavy stone-work and with a flight of steps leading
down to the water in the very bowels of the earth; but no
man ever goes near it because it is haunted by evil spirits,
and it is known that whoso disappears down the well shall
never be seen again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wazir stroked his beard and considered a moment.
Then he turned to Ram Singh who stood behind his
chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
&lsquo;There is a proverb,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that no man can be trusted
until he has been tried. Go you and get the rajah and
his people water from this well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then there flashed into Ram Singh&rsquo;s mind the first
counsel of the old guru&mdash;&lsquo;<em>Always obey without question
the orders of him whose service you enter.</em>&rsquo; So he replied
at once that he was ready, and left to prepare for his adventure.
Two great brazen vessels he fastened to a mule,
two lesser ones he bound upon his shoulders, and thus
provided he set out, with the old villager for his guide.
In a short time they came to a spot where some big trees
towered above the barren country, whilst under their
shadow lay the dome of an ancient building. This the
guide pointed out as the well, but excused himself from
going further as he was an old man and tired, and it was
already nearly sunset, so that he must be returning home.
So Ram Singh bade him farewell, and went on alone with
the mule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>Arrived at the trees, Ram Singh tied up his beast,
lifted the vessels from his shoulder, and having found
the opening of the well, descended by a flight of steps
which led down into the darkness. The steps were broad
white slabs of alabaster which gleamed in the shadows
as he went lower and lower. All was very silent. Even
the sound of his bare feet upon the pavements seemed
to wake an echo in that lonely place, and when one of
the vessels which he carried slipped and fell upon the
steps it clanged so loudly that he jumped at the noise.
Still he went on, until at last he reached a wide
pool of sweet water, and there he washed his jars with
care before he filled them, and began to remount the steps
with the lighter vessels, as the big ones were so heavy he
could only take up one at a time. Suddenly, something
moved above him, and looking up he saw a great giant
standing on the stairway! In one hand he held clasped
to his heart a dreadful looking mass of bones, in the other
was a lamp which cast long shadows about the walls,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
and made him seem even more terrible than he really
was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What think you, O mortal,&rsquo; said the giant, &lsquo;of my fair
and lovely wife?&rsquo; And he held the light towards the bones
in his arms and looked lovingly at them.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you that this poor giant had had a
very beautiful wife, whom he had loved dearly; but, when
she died, her husband refused to believe in her death, and
always carried her about long after she had become nothing
but bones. Ram Singh of course did not know of this,
but there came to his mind the second wise saying of the
guru, which forbade him to speak harshly or inconsiderately
to others; so he replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Truly, sir, I am sure you could find nowhere such
another.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, what eyes you have!&rsquo; cried the delighted giant,
&lsquo;you at least can see! I do not know how often I have
slain those who insulted her by saying she was but dried
bones! You are a fine young man, and I will help you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he laid down the bones with great tenderness,
and snatching up the huge brass vessels, carried them up
again, and replaced them with such ease that it was all
done by the time that Ram Singh had reached the open
air with the smaller ones.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the giant, &lsquo;you have pleased me, and you
may ask of me one favour, and whatever you wish I will
do it for you. Perhaps you would like me to show you
where lies buried the treasure of dead kings?&rsquo; he added
eagerly.</p>

<p>But Ram Singh shook his head at the mention of buried
wealth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The favour that I would ask,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is that you
will leave off haunting this well, so that men may go in
and out and obtain water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps the giant expected some favour more difficult to
grant, for his face brightened, and he promised to depart
at once; and as Ram Singh went off through the gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
darkness with his precious burden of water, he beheld the
giant striding away with the bones of his dead wife in his
arms.</p>

<p>Great was the wonder and rejoicing in the camp when
Ram Singh returned with the water. He never said anything,
however, about his adventure with the giant, but
merely told the rajah that there was nothing to prevent
the well being used; and used it was, and nobody ever
saw any more of the giant.</p>

<p>The rajah was so pleased with the bearing of Ram
Singh that he ordered the wazir to give the young man
to him in exchange for one of his own servants. So Ram
Singh became the rajah&rsquo;s attendant; and as the days
went by the king became more and more delighted with
the youth because, mindful of the old guru&rsquo;s third counsel,
he was always honest and spoke the truth. He grew
in favour rapidly, until at last the rajah made him his
treasurer, and thus he reached a high place in the court
and had wealth and power in his hands. Unluckily
the rajah had a brother who was a very bad man; and
this brother thought that if he could win the young
treasurer over to himself he might by this means manage
to steal little by little any of the king&rsquo;s treasure which
he needed. Then, with plenty of money, he could
bribe the soldiers and some of the rajah&rsquo;s counsellors,
head a rebellion, dethrone and kill his brother, and reign
himself instead. He was too wary, of course, to tell
Ram Singh of all these wicked plans; but he began by
flattering him whenever he saw him, and at last offered
him his daughter in marriage. But Ram Singh remembered
the fourth counsel of the old guru&mdash;never to try
to appear the equal of those above him in station&mdash;therefore
he respectfully declined the great honour of marrying
a princess. Of course the prince, baffled at the very
beginning of his enterprise, was furious, and determined
to work Ram Singh&rsquo;s ruin, and entering the rajah&rsquo;s presence
he told him a story about Ram Singh having spoken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
insulting words of his sovereign and of his daughter.
What it was all about nobody knew, and, as it was
not true, the wicked prince did not know either; but
the rajah grew very angry and red in the face as he
listened, and declared that until the treasurer&rsquo;s head was
cut off neither he nor the princess nor his brother would
eat or drink.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; added he, &lsquo;I do not wish any one to know that
this was done by my desire, and anyone who mentions
the subject will be severely punished.&rsquo; And with this the
prince was forced to be content.</p>

<p>Then the rajah sent for an officer of his guard, and
told him to take some soldiers and ride at once to a tower
which was situated just outside the town, and if anyone
should come to inquire when the building was going to
be finished, or should ask any other questions about it,
the officer must chop his head off, and bring it to him.
As for the body, that could be buried on the spot. The
old officer thought these instructions rather odd, but it
was no business of his, so he saluted, and went off to do
his master&rsquo;s bidding.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the rajah, who had not slept all
night, sent for Ram Singh, and bade him go to the new
hunting-tower, and ask the people there how it was getting
on and when it was going to be finished, and to hurry
back with the answer! Away went Ram Singh upon his
errand, but, on the road, as he was passing a little
temple on the outskirts of the city, he heard someone
inside reading aloud; and, remembering the guru&rsquo;s fifth
counsel, he just stepped inside and sat down to listen
for a minute. He did not mean to stay longer, but became
so deeply interested in the wisdom of the teacher,
that he sat, and sat, and sat, while the sun rose higher
and higher.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the wicked prince, who dared not
disobey the rajah&rsquo;s command, was feeling very hungry;
and as for the princess, she was quietly crying in a corner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
waiting for the news of Ram Singh&rsquo;s death, so that she
might eat her breakfast.</p>

<p>Hours passed, and stare as he might from the window
no messenger could be seen.</p>

<p>At last the prince could bear it no longer, and hastily
disguising himself so that no one should recognise him,
he jumped on a horse and galloped out to the hunting-tower,
where the rajah had told him that the execution
was to take place. But, when he got there, there was no
execution going on. There were only some men engaged
in building, and a number of soldiers idly watching them.
He forgot that he had disguised himself and that no one
would know him, so, riding up, he cried out:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now then, you men, why are you idling about here
instead of finishing what you came to do? When is it to
be done?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At his words the soldiers looked at the commanding
officer, who was standing a little apart from the rest.
Unperceived by the prince he made a slight sign, a sword
flashed in the sun, and off flew a head on the ground
beneath!</p>

<p>As part of the prince&rsquo;s disguise had been a thick beard,
the men did not recognise the dead man as the rajah&rsquo;s
brother; but they wrapped the head in a cloth, and buried
the body as their commander bade them. When this was
ended, the officer took the cloth, and rode off in the direction
of the palace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rajah came home from his council,
and to his great surprise found neither head nor brother
awaiting him; as time passed on, he became uneasy,
and thought that he had better go himself and see what
the matter was. So ordering his horse he rode off
alone.</p>

<p>It happened that, just as the rajah came near to the
temple where Ram Singh still sat, the young treasurer,
hearing the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs, looked over his
shoulder and saw that the rider was the rajah himself!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
Feeling much ashamed of himself for having forgotten
his errand, he jumped up and hurried out to meet his
master, who reined up his horse, and seemed very surprised
(as indeed he was) to see <em>him</em>. At that moment
there arrived the officer of the guard carrying his parcel.
He saluted the rajah gravely, and, dismounting, laid the
bundle in the road and began to undo the wrappings,
whilst the rajah watched him with wonder and interest.
When the last string was undone, and the head of his
brother was displayed to his view, the rajah sprang from
his horse and caught the soldier by the arm. As soon
as he could speak he questioned the man as to what had
occurred, and little by little a dark suspicion darted through
him. Then, briefly telling the soldier that he had done
well, the rajah drew Ram Singh to one side, and in a few
minutes learned from him how, in attending to the guru&rsquo;s
counsel, he had delayed to do the king&rsquo;s message.</p>

<p>In the end the rajah found from some papers the proofs
of his dead brother&rsquo;s treachery; and Ram Singh established
his innocence and integrity. He continued to serve the
rajah for many years with unswerving fidelity; and married
a maiden of his own rank in life, with whom he lived happily;
dying at last honoured and loved by all men. Sons
were born to him; and, in time, to them also he taught
the five wise sayings of the old guru.</p>

<h2><i>THE GOLDEN-HEADED FISH</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in Egypt a king who lost
his sight from a bad illness. Of course he was very unhappy,
and became more so as months passed, and all
the best doctors in the land were unable to cure him.
The poor man grew so thin from misery that everyone
thought he was going to die, and the prince, his only son,
thought so too.</p>

<p>Great was therefore the rejoicing through Egypt when
a traveller arrived in a boat down the river Nile, and after
questioning the people as to the reason of their downcast
looks, declared that he was court physician to the king
of a far country, and would, if allowed, examine the eyes
of the blind man. He was at once admitted into the
royal presence, and after a few minutes of careful study
announced that the case, though very serious, was not
quite hopeless.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Somewhere in the Great Sea,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there exists a
Golden-headed Fish. If you can manage to catch this
creature, bring it to me, and I will prepare an ointment
from its blood which will restore your sight. For a hundred
days I will wait here, but if at the end of that time
the fish should still be uncaught I must return to my
own master.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/ofb33.jpg" width="386" height="600"
alt="The prince looks down at the fish he holds in his hands"
title="The prince has pity on the gold-headed fish" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>The next morning the young prince set forth in quest
of the fish, taking with him a hundred men, each
man carrying a net. Quite a little fleet of boats was
awaiting them and in these they sailed to the middle of
the Great Sea. During three months they laboured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
diligently from sunrise to sunset, but though they caught
large multitudes of fishes, not one of them had a golden
head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is quite useless now,&rsquo; said the prince on the very
last night. &lsquo;Even if we find it this evening, the hundred
days will be over in an hour, and long before we
could reach the Egyptian capital the doctor will be
on his way home. Still, I will go out again, and cast
the net once more myself.&rsquo; And so he did, and at the
very moment that the hundred days were up, he drew in
the net with the Golden-headed Fish entangled in its
meshes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Success has come, but, as happens often, it is too late,&rsquo;
murmured the young man, who had studied in the schools
of philosophy; &lsquo;but, all the same, put the fish in that vessel
full of water, and we will take it back to show my father
that we have done what we could.&rsquo; But when he drew
near the fish it looked up at him with such piteous eyes
that he could not make up his mind to condemn it to death.
For he knew well that, though the doctors of his own
country were ignorant of the secret of the ointment, they
would do all in their power to extract something from
the fish&rsquo;s blood. So he picked up the prize of so much
labour, and threw it back into the sea, and then began
his journey back to the palace. When at last he reached
it he found the king in a high fever, caused by his disappointment,
and he refused to believe the story told him by
his son.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your head shall pay for it! Your head shall pay for
it!&rsquo; cried he; and bade the courtiers instantly summon
the executioner to the palace.</p>

<p>But of course somebody ran at once to the queen, and
told her of the king&rsquo;s order, and she put common clothes
on the prince, and filled his pockets with gold, and hurried
him on board a ship which was sailing that night for a
distant island.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your father will repent some day, and then he will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
be thankful to know you are alive,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;But one
last counsel will I give you, and that is, take no man into
your service who desires to be paid every month.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young prince thought this advice rather odd. If
the servant had to be paid anyhow, he did not understand
what difference it could make whether it was by the year
or by the month. However, he had many times proved
that his mother was wiser than he, so he promised obedience.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>After a voyage of several weeks, he arrived at the island
of which his mother had spoken. It was full of hills
and woods and flowers, and beautiful white houses stood
everywhere in gardens.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a charming spot to live in,&rsquo; thought the prince.
And he lost no time in buying one of the prettiest of the
dwellings.</p>

<p>Then servants came pressing to offer their services; but
as they all declared that they must have payment at the
end of every month, the young man, who remembered
his mother&rsquo;s words, declined to have anything to say to
them. At length, one morning, an Arab appeared and
begged that the prince would engage him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what wages do you ask?&rsquo; inquired the prince,
when he had questioned the new-comer and found him
suitable.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not want money,&rsquo; answered the Arab; &lsquo;at the end
of a year you can see what my services are worth to you,
and can pay me in any way you like.&rsquo; And the young
man was pleased, and took the Arab for his servant.</p>

<p>Now, although no one would have guessed it from the
look of the side of the island where the prince had landed,
the other part was a complete desert, owing to the ravages
of a horrible monster which came up from the sea, and
devoured all the corn and cattle. The governor had sent
bands of soldiers to lie in wait for the creature in order
to kill it; but, somehow, no one ever happened to be awake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
at the moment that the ravages were committed. It was
in vain that the sleepy soldiers were always punished
severely&mdash;the same thing invariably occurred next time;
and at last heralds were sent throughout the island
to offer a great reward to the man who could slay
the monster.</p>

<p>As soon as the Arab heard the news, he went straight
to the governor&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If my master can succeed in killing the monster,
what reward will you give him?&rsquo; asked he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My daughter and anything besides that he chooses,&rsquo;
answered the governor. But the Arab shook his head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give him your daughter and keep your wealth,&rsquo; said
he; &lsquo;but, henceforward, let her share in your gains, whatever
they are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; replied the governor; and ordered a deed to
be prepared, which was signed by both of them.</p>

<p>That night the Arab stole down to the shore to watch,
but, before he set out, he rubbed himself all over with
some oil which made his skin smart so badly that there
was no chance of <em>his</em> going to sleep as the soldiers had
done. Then he hid himself behind a large rock and
waited. By-and-by a swell seemed to rise on the water,
and, a few minutes later, a hideous monster&mdash;part bird,
part beast, and part serpent&mdash;stepped noiselessly on to
the rocks. It walked stealthily up towards the fields, but
the Arab was ready for it, and, as it passed, plunged his
dagger into the soft part behind the ear. The creature
staggered and gave a loud cry, and then rolled over dead,
with its feet in the sea.</p>

<p>The Arab watched for a little while, in order to make
sure that there was no life left in his enemy, but as the
huge body remained quite still, he quitted his hiding-place,
and cut off the ears of his foe. These he carried
to his master, bidding him show them to the governor,
and declare that he himself, and no other, had killed the
monster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
&lsquo;But it was you, and not I, who slew him,&rsquo; objected
the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind; do as I bid you. I have a reason for it,&rsquo;
answered the Arab. And though the young man did not
like taking credit for what he had never done, at length
he gave in.</p>

<p>The governor was so delighted at the news that he begged
the prince to take his daughter to wife that very day; but
the prince refused, saying that all he desired was a ship
which would carry him to see the world. Of course this
was granted him at once, and when he and his faithful
Arab embarked they found, heaped up in the vessel, stores
of diamonds and precious stones, which the grateful governor
had secretly placed there.</p>

<p>So they sailed, and they sailed, and they sailed; and
at length they reached the shores of a great kingdom.
Leaving the prince on board, the Arab went into the
town to find out what sort of a place it was. After
some hours he returned, saying that he heard that the
king&rsquo;s daughter was the most beautiful princess in the
world, and that the prince would do well to ask for her
hand.</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the prince listened to this advice, and
taking some of the finest necklaces in his hand, he mounted
a splendid horse which the Arab had bought for him,
and rode up to the palace, closely followed by his faithful
attendant.</p>

<p>The strange king happened to be in a good humour,
and they were readily admitted to his presence. Laying
down his offerings on the steps of the throne, he prayed
the king to grant him his daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>The monarch listened to him in silence; but answered,
after a pause:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Young man, I will give you my daughter to wife, if
that is your wish; but first I must tell you that she has
already gone through the marriage ceremony with a
hundred and ninety young men, and not one of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
lived for twelve hours after. So think, while there is yet
time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince <em>did</em> think, and was so frightened that he
very nearly went back to his ship without any more words.
But just as he was about to withdraw his proposal the
Arab whispered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fear nothing, but take her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The luck must change some time,&rsquo; he said, at last;
&lsquo;and who would not risk his head for the hand of such a
peerless princess?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you will,&rsquo; replied the king. &lsquo;Then I will give orders
that the marriage shall be celebrated to-night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so it was done; and after the ceremony the bride
and bridegroom retired to their own apartments to sup
by themselves, for such was the custom of the country.
The moon shone bright, and the prince walked to the
window to look out upon the river and upon the distant
hills, when his gaze suddenly fell on a silken shroud
neatly laid out on a couch, with his name embroidered in
gold thread across the front; for this also was the pleasure
of the king.</p>

<p>Horrified at the spectacle, he turned his head away,
and this time his glance rested on a group of men, digging
busily beneath the window. It was a strange hour for
any one to be at work, and what was the hole for? It
was a curious shape, so long and narrow, almost like&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Ah!
yes, that was what it was! It was <em>his</em> grave that they
were digging!</p>

<p>The shock of the discovery rendered him speechless,
yet he stood fascinated and unable to move. At this
moment a small black snake darted from the mouth of
the princess, who was seated at the table, and wriggled
quickly towards him. But the Arab was watching for
something of the sort to happen, and seizing the serpent
with some pincers that he held in one hand, he cut off
its head with a sharp dagger.</p>

<p>The king could hardly believe his eyes when, early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
the next morning, his new son-in-law craved an audience
of his Majesty.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What, you?&rsquo; he cried, as the young man entered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I. Why not?&rsquo; asked the bridegroom, who thought
it best to pretend not to know anything that had occurred.
&lsquo;You remember, I told you that the luck must turn
at last, and so it has. But I came to ask whether
you would be so kind as to bid the gardeners fill up a
great hole right underneath my window, which spoils
the view.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! certainly, yes; of course it shall be done!&rsquo; stammered
the king. &lsquo;Is there anything else?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, nothing, thank you,&rsquo; replied the prince, as he bowed
and withdrew.</p>

<p>Now, from the moment that the Arab cut off the snake&rsquo;s
head, the spell, or whatever it was, seemed to have been
taken off the princess, and she lived very happily with
her husband. The days passed swiftly in hunting in the
forests, or sailing on the broad river that flowed past the
palace, and when night fell she would sing to her harp, or
the prince would tell her tales of his own country.</p>

<p>One evening a man in a strange garb, with a face
burnt brown by the sun, arrived at court. He asked to
see the bridegroom, and falling on his face announced
that he was a messenger sent by the queen of Egypt,
proclaiming him king in succession to his father, who
was dead.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Her Majesty begs you will set out without delay, and
your bride also, as the affairs of the kingdom are somewhat
in disorder,&rsquo; ended the messenger.</p>

<p>Then the young man hastened to seek an audience of
his father-in-law, who was delighted to find that his daughter&rsquo;s
husband was not merely the governor of a province,
as he had supposed, but the king of a powerful country.
He at once ordered a splendid ship to be made ready,
and in a week&rsquo;s time rode down to the harbour, to bid
farewell to the young couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
In spite of her grief for the dead king, the queen was
overjoyed to welcome her son home, and commanded the
palace to be hung with splendid stuffs to do honour to
the bride. The people expected great things from their
new sovereign, for they had suffered much from the harsh
rule of the old one, and crowds presented themselves
every morning with petitions in their hands, which they
hoped to persuade the king to grant. Truly, he had
enough to keep him busy; but he was very happy for all
that, till, one night, the Arab came to him, and begged
permission to return to his own land.</p>

<p>Filled with dismay the young man said: &lsquo;Leave me!
Do you really wish to leave me?&rsquo; Sadly the Arab
bowed his head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, my master; never could I wish to leave you!
But I have received a summons, and I dare not disobey
it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king was silent, trying to choke down the grief he
felt at the thought of losing his faithful servant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I must not try to keep you,&rsquo; he faltered out at
last. &lsquo;That would be a poor return for all that you have
done for me! Everything I have is yours; take what
you will, for without you I should long ago have been
dead!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And without <em>you</em>, <em>I</em> should long ago have been dead,&rsquo;
answered the Arab. &lsquo;<em>I</em> am the Golden-headed Fish.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>DORANI</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in a city of Hindustan a
seller of scents and essences, who had a very beautiful
daughter named Dorani. This maiden had a friend who
was a fairy, and the two were high in favour with Indra,
the king of fairyland, because they were able to sing so
sweetly and dance so deftly that no one in the kingdom
could equal them for grace and beauty. Dorani had the
most lovely hair in the world, for it was like spun gold,
and the smell of it was like the smell of fresh roses. But
her locks were so long and thick that the weight of it was
often unbearable, and one day she cut off a shining tress,
and wrapping it in a large leaf, threw it in the river which
ran just below her window. Now it happened that the
king&rsquo;s son was out hunting, and had gone down to the
river to drink, when there floated towards him a folded
leaf, from which came a perfume of roses. The prince,
with idle curiosity, took a step into the water and caught
the leaf as it was sailing by. He opened it, and within
he found a lock of hair like spun gold, and from which
came a faint, exquisite odour.</p>

<p>When the prince reached home that day he looked so
sad and was so quiet that his father wondered if any ill
had befallen him, and asked what was the matter. Then
the youth took from his breast the tress of hair which
he had found in the river, and holding it up to the light,
replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;See, my father, was ever hair like this? Unless I
may win and marry the maiden that owns that lock I
must die!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
So the king immediately sent heralds throughout all
his dominions to search for the damsel with hair like spun
gold; and at last he learned that she was the daughter
of the scent-seller. The object of the herald&rsquo;s mission was
quickly noised abroad, and Dorani heard of it with the
rest; and, one day, she said to her father:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If the hair is mine, and the king requires me to marry
his son, I must do so; but, remember, you must tell him
that if, after the wedding, I stay all day at the palace,
every night will be spent in my old home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man listened to her with amazement, but
answered nothing, as he knew she was wiser than he.
Of course the hair was Dorani&rsquo;s, and heralds soon
returned and informed the king, their master, who summoned
the scent-seller, and told him that he wished for
his daughter to be given in marriage to the prince. The
father bowed his head three times to the ground, and
replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your highness is our lord, and all that you bid us we
will do. The maiden asks this only&mdash;that if, after the
wedding, she stays all day at the palace, she may go back
each night to her father&rsquo;s house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king thought this a very strange request; but said
to himself it was, after all, his son&rsquo;s affair, and the girl
would surely soon get tired of going to and fro. So he
made no difficulty, and everything was speedily arranged
and the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicings.</p>

<p>At first, the condition attaching to his wedding with
the lovely Dorani troubled the prince very little, for he
thought that he would at least see his bride all day. But,
to his dismay, he found that she would do nothing but sit
the whole time upon a stool with her head bowed forward
upon her knees, and he could never persuade her to say
a single word. Each evening she was carried in a palanquin
to her father&rsquo;s house, and each morning she was
brought back soon after daybreak; and yet never a sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
passed her lips, nor did she show by any sign that she
saw, or heard, or heeded her husband.</p>

<p>One evening the prince, very unhappy and troubled,
was wandering in an old and beautiful garden near the
palace. The gardener was a very aged man, who had
served the prince&rsquo;s great grandfather; and when he saw the
prince he came and bowed himself to him, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Child! child! why do you look so sad&mdash;is aught the
matter?&rsquo; Then the prince replied, &lsquo;I am sad, old friend,
because I have married a wife as lovely as the stars, but
she will not speak to me, and I know not what to do.
Night after night she leaves me for her father&rsquo;s house,
and day after day she sits in mine as though turned to
stone, and utters no word, whatever I may do or say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man stood thinking for a moment, and then
he hobbled off to his own cottage. A little later he came
back to the prince with five or six small packets, which
he placed in his hands and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;To-morrow, when your bride leaves the palace,
sprinkle the powder from one of these packets upon your
body, and while seeing clearly, you will become yourself
invisible. More I cannot do for you, but may all go
well!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the prince thanked him, and put the packets carefully
away in his turban.</p>

<p>The next night, when Dorani left for her father&rsquo;s house
in her palanquin, the prince took out a packet of the magic
powder and sprinkled it over himself, and then hurried
after her. He soon found that, as the old man had promised,
he was invisible to everyone, although he felt as
usual, and could see all that passed. He speedily overtook
the palanquin and walked beside it to the scent-seller&rsquo;s
dwelling. There it was set down, and, when his bride,
closely veiled, left it and entered the house, he, too, entered
unperceived.</p>

<p>At the first door Dorani removed one veil; then she
entered another doorway at the end of a passage where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
she removed another veil; next she mounted the stairs,
and at the door of the women&rsquo;s quarters removed a third
veil. After this she proceeded to her own room where
were set two large basins, one of attar of roses and one
of water; in these she washed herself, and afterwards
called for food. A servant brought her a bowl of curds,
which she ate hastily, and then arrayed herself in a robe
of silver, and wound about her strings of pearls, while a
wreath of roses crowned her hair. When fully dressed,
she seated herself upon a four-legged stool over which
was a canopy with silken curtains, these she drew around
her, and then called out:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fly, stool, to the palace of rajah Indra.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the stool rose in the air, and the invisible
prince, who had watched all these proceedings with great
wonder, seized it by one leg as it flew away, and found
himself being borne through the air at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>In a short while they arrived at the house of the fairy
who, as I told you before, was the favourite friend of Dorani.
The fairy stood waiting on the threshold, as beautifully
dressed as Dorani herself was, and when the stool stopped
at her door she cried in astonishment:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, the stool is flying all crooked to-day! What
is the reason of that, I wonder? I suspect that you
have been talking to your husband, and so it will not fly
straight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Dorani declared that she had not spoken one word
to him, and she couldn&rsquo;t think why the stool flew as if
weighed down at one side. The fairy still looked doubtful,
but made no answer, and took her seat beside Dorani,
the prince again holding tightly one leg. Then the stool
flew on through the air until it came to the palace of Indra
the rajah.</p>

<p>All through the night the women sang and danced
before the rajah Indra, whilst a magic lute played of itself
the most bewitching music; till the prince, who sat watching
it all, was quite entranced. Just before dawn the rajah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
gave the signal to cease; and again the two women seated
themselves on the stool, and, with the prince clinging to
the leg, it flew back to earth, and bore Dorani and her
husband safely to the scent-seller&rsquo;s shop. Here the prince
hurried away by himself past Dorani&rsquo;s palanquin with
its sleepy bearers, straight on to the palace; and, as he
passed the threshold of his own rooms he became visible
again. Then he lay down upon a couch and waited for
Dorani&rsquo;s arrival.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
As soon as she arrived she took a seat and remained
as silent as usual, with her head bowed on her knees.
For a while not a sound was heard, but presently the prince
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dreamed a curious dream last night, and as it was
all about you I am going to tell it you, although you heed
nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl, indeed, took no notice of his words, but in
spite of that he proceeded to relate every single thing
that had happened the evening before, leaving out no
detail of all that he had seen or heard. And when he
praised her singing&mdash;and his voice shook a little&mdash;Dorani
just looked at him; but she said naught, though, in her
own mind, she was filled with wonder. &lsquo;What a dream!&rsquo;
she thought. &lsquo;Could it have been a dream? How could
he have learnt in a dream all she had done or said?&rsquo; Still
she kept silent; only she looked that once at the prince,
and then remained all day as before, with her head bowed
upon her knees.</p>

<p>When night came the prince again made himself
invisible and followed her. The same things happened
again as had happened before, but Dorani sang better
than ever. In the morning the prince a second time told
Dorani all that she had done, pretending that he had
dreamt of it. Directly he had finished Dorani gazed at
him, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it true that you dreamt this, or were you really
there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was there,&rsquo; answered the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why do you follow me?&rsquo; asked the girl.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; replied the prince, &lsquo;I love you, and to be
with you is happiness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This time Dorani&rsquo;s eyelids quivered; but she said no
more, and was silent the rest of the day. However, in
the evening, just as she was stepping into her palanquin,
she said to the prince:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
&lsquo;If you love me, prove it by not following me to-night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so the prince did as she wished, and stayed at
home.</p>

<p>That evening the magic stool flew so unsteadily that
they could hardly keep their seats, and at last the fairy
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is only one reason that it should jerk like this!
You have been talking to your husband!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Dorani replied: &lsquo;Yes, I have spoken; oh, yes, I
have spoken!&rsquo; But no more would she say.</p>

<p>That night Dorani sang so marvellously that at the
end the rajah Indra rose up and vowed that she might
ask what she would and he would give it to her. At
first she was silent; but, when he pressed her, she
answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give me the magic lute.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The rajah, when he heard this, was displeased with
himself for having made so rash a promise, because this
lute he valued above all his possessions. But as he had
promised, so he must perform, and with an ill grace he
handed it to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must never come here again,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for, once
having asked so much, how will you in future be content
with smaller gifts?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dorani bowed her head silently as she took the lute,
and passed with the fairy out of the great gate, where the
stool awaited them. More unsteadily than before, it flew
back to earth.</p>

<p>When Dorani got to the palace that morning she asked
the prince whether he had dreamt again. He laughed
with happiness, for this time she had spoken to him of
her own free will; and he replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; but I begin to dream now&mdash;not of what <em>has</em>
happened in the past, but of what <em>may</em> happen in the
future.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That day Dorani sat very quietly, but she answered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
prince when he spoke to her; and when evening fell, and
with it the time for her departure, she still sat on. Then
the prince came close to her and said softly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you not going to your house, Dorani?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At that she rose and threw herself weeping into his
arms, whispering gently:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never again, my lord, never again would I leave
thee!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the prince won his beautiful bride; and though
they neither of them dealt any further with fairies and
their magic, they learnt more daily of the magic of Love,
which one may still learn, although fairy magic has fled
away.</p>

<h2><i>THE SATIN SURGEON</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a very rich and powerful
king who, in spite of having been married several times,
had only two daughters.</p>

<p>The elder was extremely plain&mdash;she squinted and was
hunchbacked; but at the same time she was very clever and
amusing, so, though at heart both spiteful and untruthful,
she was her father&rsquo;s favourite.</p>

<p>The younger princess, on the other hand, was both
lovely and sweet-tempered, and those who knew her well
could hardly say whether her charming face or pleasant
manners was the more attractive.</p>

<p>The neighbouring country was governed by a young
emperor, who, though not much over twenty years of age,
had shown great courage in battle, and, had he wished
it, might very likely have conquered the whole world.
Luckily he preferred peace to war, and occupied his time
with trying to rule his own kingdom well and wisely. His
people were very anxious that he should marry, and as
the two princesses were the only ladies to be heard of of
suitable age and rank, the emperor sent envoys to their
father&rsquo;s court to ask for the hand of one of them in marriage.
But, as he was resolved only to marry a woman
whom he could love and be happy with, he determined to
see the lady himself before making up his mind. For this
purpose he set out in disguise not long after the departure
of his ambassadors, and arrived at the palace very soon
after they did; but as he had foolishly kept his plan secret,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
he found, when he reached the court, that they had already
made proposals for the elder princess.</p>

<p>Now the emperor might just as well have gone openly,
for his presence soon became known; and when the king
heard of it he prepared to receive him royally, though of
course he had to pretend that he had no idea who he was.
So it was settled that the ambassadors should present their
master under the name of one of the princes, and in this
manner he was received by the king.</p>

<p>At night there was a grand ball at which the young
emperor was able to see the two princesses and to make
their acquaintance. The ugly face and figure and spiteful
remarks of the elder displeased him so greatly that he
felt he could not marry her even if she owned ten kingdoms,
whilst the sweet face and gentle manners of the younger
sister charmed him so much that he would gladly have
shared his throne with her had she been only a simple
shepherdess.</p>

<p>He found it very difficult to conceal his thoughts and
to pay the elder princess the amount of attention due to
her, though he did his best to be polite; while all he saw
or heard during the next few days only increased his love
for her younger sister, and at last he confessed that his
dearest wish was to make her his wife, if she and her father
would grant his desire.</p>

<p>He had commanded his ambassadors to put off their
farewell audience for a little time, hoping that the king
might perceive the state of his feelings; but when it could
be deferred no longer, he bade them propose in his name
for the younger princess.</p>

<p>On hearing this news, so different from what he had
been led to expect, the king who&mdash;as we have said before&mdash;was
devoted to his elder daughter and entirely under
her influence, could hardly contain his displeasure. Directly
the audience was over he sent for the princess
and told her of the insolent proposal the emperor had
made for her sister. The princess was even more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
furious than her father, and after consulting together
they decided to send the younger daughter to some
distant place out of reach of the young emperor; but
<em>where</em> this should be they did not quite know. However,
at length, after they had both racked their brains to find
a suitable prison, they fixed on a lonely castle called the
Desert Tower, where they thought she would be quite
safe.</p>

<p>Meantime, it was thought best to let the court gaieties
go on as usual, and orders were given for all sorts of
splendid entertainments; and on the day that was fixed
for carrying off the princess, the whole court was invited
to a great hunt in the forest.</p>

<p>The emperor and the young princess were counting
the hours till this morning, which promised to be so
delightful, should dawn. The king and his guest arrived
together at the meeting-place, but what was the surprise
and distress of the young man at not seeing the object of
his love amongst the ladies present. He waited anxiously,
looking up and down, not hearing anything that the king
said to him; and when the hunt began and she still was
absent, he declined to follow, and spent the whole day
seeking her, but in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/ofb36.jpg" width="378" height="600"
alt="The princess reaches down from her window"
title="The princess gets her letter" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>On his return, one of his attendants told him that some
hours before he had met the princess&rsquo;s carriage, escorted
by a troop of soldiers who were riding on each side, so
that no one could get speech of her. He had followed
them at a distance, and saw them stop at the Desert Tower,
and on its return he noticed that the carriage was empty.
The emperor was deeply grieved by this news. He left
the court at once, and ordered his ambassadors to declare
war the very next day, unless the king promised to set
free the princess. And more than this, no sooner had he
reached his own country than he raised a large army,
with which he seized the frontier towns, before his enemy
had had time to collect any troops. But, ere he quitted the
court, he took care to write a letter to his beloved princess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
imploring her to have patience and trust to him; and this
he gave into the hands of his favourite equerry, who would
he knew lay down his life in his service.</p>

<p>With many precautions the equerry managed to examine
the surroundings of the tower, and at last discovered,
not only where the princess lodged, but that a little window
in her room looked out on a desolate plot full of
brambles.</p>

<p>Now the unhappy princess was much annoyed that she
was not even allowed to take the air at this little window,
which was the only one in her room. Her keeper was
her elder sister&rsquo;s former nurse, a woman whose eyes never
slept. Not for an instant could she be induced to stir
from the side of the princess, and she watched her slightest
movement.</p>

<p>One day, however, the spy was for once busy in her
room writing an account of the princess to her elder sister,
and the poor prisoner seized the opportunity to lean out of
the window. As she looked about her she noticed a man
hidden amongst the bushes, who stepped forward as soon
as he caught sight of her, and showed her a letter, which
he took from his jerkin. She at once recognised him as
one of the emperor&rsquo;s attendants, and let down a long string,
to which he tied the letter. You can fancy how quickly
she drew it up again, and luckily she had just time to
read it before her gaoler had finished her report and entered
the room.</p>

<p>The princess&rsquo;s delight was great, and next day she
managed to write an answer on a sheet of her note book,
and to throw it down to the equerry, who hastened to carry
it back to his master. The emperor was so happy at
having news of his dear princess, that he resolved, at all
risks, to visit the Desert Tower himself, if only to see her
for a moment. He ordered his equerry to ask leave to
visit her, and the princess replied that she should indeed
rejoice to see him, but that she feared that her gaoler&rsquo;s
watchfulness would make his journey useless, unless he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
came during the short time when the old woman was
writing alone in her own room.</p>

<p>Naturally, the bare idea of difficulties only made the
emperor more eager than ever. He was ready to run any
risks, but, by the advice of the equerry, he decided to try
cunning rather than force. In his next letter he enclosed
a sleeping powder, which the princess managed to mix
with her gaoler&rsquo;s supper, so that when the emperor reached
the tower in the evening the princess appeared fearlessly
at her window on hearing his signal. They had a long
and delightful conversation, and parted in the fond hope
that their meeting had not been observed. But in this
they were sadly mistaken. The watchful eyes of the old
nurse were proof against any sleeping draught&mdash;she had
seen and heard all; and lost no time in writing to report
everything to her mistress.</p>

<p>The news made the spiteful little hunchback furious,
and she resolved to be cruelly revenged for the contempt
with which the emperor had treated her. She ordered
her nurse to pretend not to notice what might be passing,
and meantime she had a trap made so that if the emperor
pushed his way through the brambles at the foot of the
tower, it would not only catch him, as if he were a mouse,
but would let loose a number of poisoned arrows, which
would pierce him all over. When it was ready, the trap
was hidden amongst the brambles without being observed
by the princess.</p>

<p>That same evening the emperor hurried to the tower
with all the impatience of love. As he came near he heard
the princess break into a long, joyous peal of laughter.
He advanced quickly to give the usual signal, when suddenly
his foot trod on something, he knew not what. A
sharp, stinging pain ran through him, and he turned white
and faint, but, luckily, the trap had only opened a little
way, and only a few of the arrows flew out. For a moment
he staggered, and then fell to the ground covered with
blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
Had he been alone he would have died very shortly,
but his faithful squire was close at hand, and carried his
master off to the wood where the rest of his escort were
waiting for him. His wounds were bound up, and some
poles were cut to make a rough litter, and, almost unconscious,
the emperor was borne away out of his enemy&rsquo;s
country to his own palace.</p>

<p>All this time the princess was feeling very anxious.
She had been whiling away the hours before this meeting
by playing with a little pet monkey, which had been
making such funny faces that, in spite of her troubles,
she had burst into the hearty laugh overheard by the
emperor. But by-and-by she grew restless, waiting for
the signal which never came, and, had she dared, would
certainly have rebelled when her gaoler, whom she
believed to be fast asleep, ordered her to go to bed at
once.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed, which was spent in great anxiety
by the poor girl, who grew thin and weak with the
uncertainty. At the end of this period, when the nurse
went to her room one morning as usual in order to write
her daily report, she carelessly left the key in the door.
This was perceived by the princess, who turned it upon
her so quickly and quietly that she never found out she
was locked in till she had finished writing, and got up to
seek her charge.</p>

<p>Finding herself free, the princess flew to the window,
and to her horror saw the arrows lying about amongst
the bloodstained brambles. Distracted with terror she
slipped down the stairs and out of the tower, and ran for
some time along a path, when with great good luck she
met the husband of her own nurse, who had only just
learned of her imprisonment, and was on his way to try
and find out whether he could serve her. The princess
begged him to get her some men&rsquo;s clothes while she
awaited him in a little wood close by. The good man
was overjoyed to be of use, and started at once for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
nearest town, where he soon discovered a shop where the
court lackeys were accustomed to sell their masters&rsquo; cast-off
clothes. The princess dressed herself at once in the
disguise he had brought, which was of rich material and
covered with precious stones; and, putting her own garments
into a bag, which her servant hung over his shoulders, they
both set out on their journey.</p>

<p>This lasted longer than either of them expected. They
walked by day as far as the princess could manage, and
by night they slept in the open air. One evening they
camped in a lovely valley watered by a rippling stream,
and towards morning the princess was awakened by a
charming voice singing one of the songs of her own childhood.
Anxious to find out where the sound came from,
she walked to a thicket of myrtles, where she saw a little
boy with a quiver at his back and an ivory bow in his hand,
singing softly to himself as he smoothed the feathers of
his shafts.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you surprised at seeing my eyes open?&rsquo; he asked,
with a smile. &lsquo;Ah! I am not always blind. And sometimes
it is well to know what sort of a heart needs piercing.
It was I who sent out my darts the day that you and the
emperor met, so, as I have caused the wound, I am in duty
bound to find the cure!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he gave her a little bottle full of a wonderful salve
with which to dress the emperor&rsquo;s wounds when she found
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In two days you can reach his palace,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Do
not waste time, for sometimes time is life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess thanked the boy with tears in her eyes,
and hastened to awake her guide so that they might start,
and set off at once on their way.</p>

alt="The disguised princess speaks to the boy in the myrtle thicket"
title="The boy in the valley" />
</div>

<p>As the boy had foretold, in two days the tower and
walls of the city came in sight, and her heart beat wildly
at the thought that she would soon be face to face with
the emperor, but on inquiring after his health she learned,
to her horror, that he was sinking fast. For a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
her grief was so great that she nearly betrayed herself.
Then, calling all her courage to her aid, she announced
that she was a doctor, and that if they would leave
him in her charge for a few days she would promise to
cure him.</p>

<p>Now, in order to make a good appearance at court
the new doctor resolved to have an entire suit made of
pale blue satin. She bought the richest, most splendid
stuff to be had in the shops, and summoned a tailor to
make it for her, engaging to pay him double if he would
finish the work in two hours. Next she went to the
market, where she bought a fine mule, bidding her servant
see that its harness was adorned with trappings of blue
satin also.</p>

<p>Whilst all was being made ready the princess asked
the woman in whose house she lived whether she knew
any of the emperor&rsquo;s attendants, and found to her satisfaction
that her cousin was his majesty&rsquo;s chief valet. The
doctor then bade the woman inform everyone she met
that on hearing of the emperor&rsquo;s illness a celebrated surgeon
had hastened to attend him, and had undertaken to
cure him entirely; declaring himself prepared to be burnt
alive in case of failure.</p>

<p>The good woman, who loved nothing better than a
bit of gossip, hurried to the palace with her news. Her
story did not lose in telling. The court physicians were
very scornful about the new-comer, but the emperor&rsquo;s
attendants remarked that as, in spite of their remedies,
his majesty was dying before their eyes, there could be
no harm in consulting this stranger.</p>

<p>So the lord chamberlain begged the young doctor to
come and prescribe for the royal patient without delay;
and the doctor sent a message at once, that he would do
himself the honour to present himself at the palace, and
he lost no time in mounting his mule and setting out.
As the people and soldiers saw him ride past they cried
out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
&lsquo;Here comes the Satin Surgeon! Look at the Satin
Surgeon! Long live the Satin Surgeon!&rsquo; And, on arriving,
he was announced by this name, and at once taken to the
sick room of the dying man.</p>

<p>The emperor was lying with his eyes closed, and his
face as white as the pillow itself; but directly he heard
the new-comer&rsquo;s voice, he looked up and smiled, and
signed that he wished the new doctor to remain near him.
Making a low bow, the Satin Surgeon assured the emperor
that he felt certain of curing his malady, but insisted that
everyone should leave the room except the emperor&rsquo;s
favourite equerry. He then dressed the wounds with the
magic salve which the boy had given him, and it so relieved
the emperor&rsquo;s pain that he slept soundly all that
night.</p>

<p>When morning broke, the courtiers and doctors hurried
to the emperor&rsquo;s chamber, and were much surprised to
find him free of pain. But they were promptly ordered
out of the room by the Satin Surgeon, who renewed the
dressings with such good results that next morning the
emperor was nearly well, and able to leave his bed. As
he grew stronger, his thoughts dwelt more and more on
the cause of all his sufferings, and his spirits grew worse
as his health grew better. The face and voice of his new
doctor reminded him of the princess who had, he imagined,
betrayed him, and caused him such dreadful torture;
and, unable to bear the thought, his eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>The doctor noticed his sad countenance and did all he
could to enliven his patient with cheerful talk and amusing
stories, till at last he won the emperor&rsquo;s confidence and
heard all the story of his love for a lady who had treated
him cruelly, but whom, in spite of everything, he could
not help loving. The Satin Surgeon listened with sympathy,
and tried to persuade the emperor that possibly the
princess was not so much to blame as might appear; but,
eager though the sick man was to believe this, it took a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
long while to persuade him of it. At length a day came
when the emperor was nearly well, and for the last time
the doctor dressed the wounds with the precious salve.
Then, both patient and surgeon, being wearied out with
something they could not explain, fell asleep and slept for
hours.</p>

<p>Early next morning, the princess, having decided to
resume her own clothes which she had brought with her
in a bag, dressed herself with great care and put on
all her jewels so as to make herself look as lovely as
possible. She had just finished when the emperor
awoke, feeling so strong and well that he thought he
must be dreaming, nor could he believe himself to be
awake when he saw the princess draw aside his curtains.</p>

<p>For some minutes they gazed at each other, unable
to speak, and then they only uttered little gasps of joy
and thankfulness. By-and-by the princess told him the
whole story of her adventures since their last interview
at the Desert Tower; and the emperor, weak as he was,
threw himself at her feet with vows of love and gratitude,
without ever giving a thought to the fact that the household
and court physicians were awaiting their summons in the
ante-room.</p>

<p>The emperor, anxious to prove how much he owed to
the Satin Surgeon, opened his door himself, and great
was everyone&rsquo;s surprise and joy at seeing him in such
perfect health. Like good courtiers, they hastened in to
praise and compliment the Satin Surgeon, but what was
their astonishment on finding that he had disappeared,
leaving in his place the loveliest princess in the whole
world.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whilst thanking the surgeon for his miraculous cure,
you might at the same time do homage to your empress,&rsquo;
observed the emperor. He wished to have the marriage
celebrated the same day, but the princess declared that
she must wait to get her father&rsquo;s permission first.</p>

<p>Messengers were therefore instantly despatched to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
neighbouring capital, and soon returned with the king&rsquo;s
consent, for he had lately discovered all the mischief caused
by his elder daughter.</p>

<p>The spiteful princess was so furious at the failure of
her plans that she took to her bed, and died in a fit of
rage and jealousy. No one grieved for her, and the king,
being tired of the fatigues of Government, gave up his
crown to his younger daughter; so the two kingdoms
henceforth became one.</p>

<h2><i>THE BILLY GOAT AND THE KING</i></h2>


<p>Once there lived a certain king who understood the language
of all birds and beasts and insects. This knowledge
had of course been given him by a fairy godmother; but
it was rather a troublesome present, for he knew that if
he were ever to reveal anything he had thus learned he
would turn into a stone. How he managed to avoid doing
so long before this story opens I cannot say, but he had
safely grown up to manhood, and married a wife, and was
as happy as monarchs generally are.</p>

<p>This king, I must tell you, was a Hindu; and when a
Hindu eats his food he has a nice little place on the ground
freshly plastered with mud, and he sits in the middle of it
with very few clothes on&mdash;which is quite a different way
from ours.</p>

<p>Well, one day the king was eating his dinner in just
such a nice, clean, mud-plastered spot, and his wife was
sitting opposite to wait upon him and keep him company.
As he ate he dropped some grains of rice upon the ground,
and a little ant, who was running about seeking a living,
seized upon one of the grains and bore it off towards his
hole. Just outside the king&rsquo;s circle this ant met another
ant, and the king heard the second one say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear friend, do give me that grain of rice, and
get another one for yourself. You see my boots are so
dirty that, if I were to go upon the king&rsquo;s eating place,
I should defile it, and I can&rsquo;t do that, it would be so very
rude.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the owner of the grain of rice only replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
&lsquo;If you want rice go and get it. No one will notice
your dirty boots; and you don&rsquo;t suppose that I am going
to carry rice for all our kindred?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king laughed.</p>

<p>The queen looked at herself up and down, but she could
not see or feel anything in her appearance to make the
king laugh, so she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What are you laughing at?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did I laugh?&rsquo; replied the king.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you did,&rsquo; retorted the queen; &lsquo;and if you
think that I am ridiculous I wish you would say so, instead
of behaving in that stupid way! What are you laughing
at?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing at anything,&rsquo; answered the king.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, but you <em>did</em> laugh, and I want to know
why.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; said the king.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You <em>must</em> tell me,&rsquo; replied the queen impatiently. &lsquo;If
you laugh when there&rsquo;s nothing to laugh at you must be
ill or mad. What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still the king refused to say, and still the queen declared
that she must and would know. For days the quarrel
went on, and the queen gave her husband no rest, until
at last the poor man was almost out of his wits, and thought
that, as life had become for him hardly worth living while
this went on, he might as well tell her the secret and take
the consequences.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;if I am to become a stone, I am
not going to lie, if I can help it, on some dusty highway,
to be kicked here and there by man and beast, flung at
dogs, be used as the plaything of naughty children, and
become generally restless and miserable. I will be a
stone at the bottom of the cool river, and roll gently about
there until I find some secure resting-place where I can
stay for ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he told his wife that if she would ride with him
to the middle of the river he would tell her what he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
laughed at. She thought he was joking, and laughingly
agreed; their horses were ordered and they set out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="king_laughs" id="king_laughs"></a>
<img src="images/ofb38.jpg" width="400" height="500"
alt="The king laughs at the billygoat" />
</div>

<p>On the way they came to a fine well beneath the shade
of some lofty, wide-spreading trees, and the king proposed
that they should get off and rest a little, drink some of
the cool water, and then pass on. To this the queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
consented; so they dismounted and sat down in the shade
by the well-side to rest.</p>

<p>It happened that an old goat and his wife were browsing
in the neighbourhood, and, as the king and queen sat
there, the nanny goat came to the well&rsquo;s brink and peering
over saw some lovely green leaves that sprang in tender
shoots out of the side of the well.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried she to her husband, &lsquo;come quickly and
look. Here are some leaves which make my mouth water;
come and get them for me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the billy goat sauntered up and looked over, and
after that he eyed his wife a little crossly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You expect me to get you those leaves, do you? I
suppose you don&rsquo;t consider how in the world I am to reach
them? You don&rsquo;t seem to think at all; if you did you
would know that if I tried to reach those leaves I should
fall into the well and be drowned!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; cried the nanny goat, &lsquo;why should you fall in?
Do try and get them!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not going to be so silly,&rsquo; replied the billy
goat.</p>

<p>But the nanny goat still wept and entreated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said her husband, &lsquo;there are plenty of
fools in the world, but I am not one of them. This silly
king here, because he can&rsquo;t cure his wife of asking questions,
is going to throw his life away. But I know how
to cure you of your follies, and I&rsquo;m going to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with that he butted the nanny goat so severely
that in two minutes she was submissively feeding somewhere
else, and had made up her mind that the leaves in
the well were not worth having.</p>

<p>Then the king, who had understood every word, laughed
once more.</p>

<p>The queen looked at him suspiciously, but the king got
up and walked across to where she sat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you still determined to find out what I was laughing
at the other day?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; answered the queen angrily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said the king, tapping his leg with his riding
whip, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind not to tell you, and moreover,
I have made up my mind to stop you mentioning the subject
any more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What <em>do</em> you mean?&rsquo; asked the queen nervously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the king, &lsquo;I notice that if that goat is
displeased with his wife, he just butts her, and that seems
to settle the question&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say you would <em>beat</em> me?&rsquo; cried the
queen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should be extremely sorry to have to do so,&rsquo; replied
the king; &lsquo;but I have got to persuade you to go home
quietly, and to ask no more silly questions when I say
I cannot answer them. Of course, if you <em>will</em> persist,
why&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the queen went home, and so did the king; and
it is said that they are both happier and wiser than ever
before.</p>

<h2><i>THE STORY OF ZOULVISIA</i></h2>


<p>In the midst of a sandy desert, somewhere in Asia, the
eyes of travellers are refreshed by the sight of a high mountain
covered with beautiful trees, among which the glitter
of foaming waterfalls may be seen in the sunlight. In
that clear, still air it is even possible to hear the song of
the birds, and smell of the flowers; but though the mountain
is plainly inhabited&mdash;for here and there a white tent is
visible&mdash;none of the kings or princes who pass it on
the road to Babylon or Baalbec ever plunge into its forests&mdash;or,
if they do, they never come back. Indeed, so great
is the terror caused by the evil reputation of the mountain
that fathers, on their death-beds, pray their sons never
to try to fathom its mysteries. But in spite of its ill-fame,
a certain number of young men every year announce their
intention of visiting it and, as we have said, are never
seen again.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Now there was once a powerful king who ruled over a
country on the other side of the desert, and, when dying,
gave the usual counsel to his seven sons. Hardly,
however, was he dead than the eldest, who succeeded to
the throne, announced his intention of hunting in the
enchanted mountain. In vain the old men shook their
heads and tried to persuade him to give up his mad
scheme. All was useless; he went, but did not return;
and in due time the throne was filled by his next
brother.</p>

<p>And so it happened to the other five, but when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
youngest became king, and he also proclaimed a hunt in
the mountain, a loud lament was raised in the city.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who will reign over us when you are dead? For
dead you surely will be,&rsquo; cried they. &lsquo;Stay with us, and
we will make you happy.&rsquo; And for a while he listened to
their prayers, and the land grew rich and prosperous
under his rule. But in a few years the restless fit again
took possession of him, and this time he would hear nothing.
Hunt in that forest he would, and calling his friends and
attendants round him, he set out one morning across the
desert.</p>

<p>They were riding through a rocky valley, when a deer
sprang up in front of them and bounded away. The
king instantly gave chase, followed by his attendants;
but the animal ran so swiftly that they never could get
up to it, and at length it vanished in the depths of the
forest.</p>

<p>Then the young man drew rein for the first time, and
looked about him. He had left his companions far behind,
and, glancing back, he beheld them entering some tents,
dotted here and there amongst the trees. For himself, the
fresh coolness of the woods was more attractive to him
than any food, however delicious, and for hours he strolled
about as his fancy led him.</p>

<p>By-and-by, however, it began to grow dark, and he
thought that the moment had arrived for them to start
for the palace. So, leaving the forest with a sigh, he made
his way down to the tents, but what was his horror to find
his men lying about, some dead, some dying. These
were past speech, but speech was needless. It was as
clear as day that the wine they had drunk contained deadly
poison.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am too late to help you, my poor friends,&rsquo; he said,
gazing at them sadly; &lsquo;but at least I can avenge you!
Those that have set the snare will certainly return to see
to its working. I will hide myself somewhere, and discover
who they are!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
Near the spot where he stood he noticed a large
walnut tree, and into this he climbed. Night soon fell,
and nothing broke the stillness of the place; but with the
earliest glimpse of dawn a noise of galloping hoofs was
heard.</p>

<p>Pushing the branches aside the young man beheld a
youth approaching, mounted on a white horse. On reaching
the tents the cavalier dismounted, and closely inspected
the dead bodies that lay about them. Then, one by one,
he dragged them to a ravine close by and threw them
into a lake at the bottom. While he was doing this, the
servants who had followed him led away the horses of
the ill-fated men, and the courtiers were ordered to let
loose the deer, which was used as a decoy, and to see that
the tables in the tents were covered as before with food
and wine.</p>

<p>Having made these arrangements he strolled slowly
through the forest, but great was his surprise to come
upon a beautiful horse hidden in the depths of a thicket.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There was a horse for every dead man,&rsquo; he said to
himself. &lsquo;Then whose is this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mine!&rsquo; answered a voice from a walnut tree close
by. &lsquo;Who are you that lure men into your power and
then poison them? But you shall do so no longer.
Return to your house, wherever it may be, and we will
fight before it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The cavalier remained speechless with anger at these
words; then with a great effort he replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I accept your challenge. Mount and follow me. I am
Zoulvisia.&rsquo; And, springing on his horse, he was out of
sight so quickly that the king had only time to notice that
light seemed to flow from himself and his steed, and that
the hair under his helmet was like liquid gold.</p>

<p>Clearly, the cavalier was a woman. But who could
she be? Was she queen of all the queens? Or was she
chief of a band of robbers? She was neither: only a
beautiful maiden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
Wrapped in these reflections, he remained standing
beneath the walnut tree, long after horse and rider had
vanished from sight. Then he awoke with a start, to
remember that he must find the way to the house of his
enemy, though where it was he had no notion. However,
he took the path down which the rider had come, and
walked along it for many hours till he came to three huts
side by side, in each of which lived an old fairy and her
sons.</p>

<p>The poor king was by this time so tired and hungry
that he could hardly speak, but when he had drunk some
milk, and rested a little, he was able to reply to the questions
they eagerly put to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am going to seek Zoulvisia,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;she has slain
my brothers and many of my subjects, and I mean to
avenge them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had only spoken to the inhabitants of one house,
but from all three came an answering murmur.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a pity we did not know! Twice this day has
she passed our door, and we might have kept her
prisoner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But though their words were brave their hearts were
not, for the mere thought of Zoulvisia made them
tremble.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Forget Zoulvisia, and stay with us,&rsquo; they all said,
holding out their hands; &lsquo;you shall be our big brother,
and we will be your little brothers.&rsquo; But the king would
not.</p>

<p>Drawing from his pocket a pair of scissors, a razor
and a mirror, he gave one to each of the old fairies,
saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Though I may not give up my vengeance I accept
your friendship, and therefore leave you these three tokens.
If blood should appear on the face of either know that my
life is in danger, and, in memory of our sworn brotherhood,
come to my aid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We will come,&rsquo; they answered. And the king mounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
his horse and set out along the road they showed
him.</p>

<p>By the light of the moon he presently perceived a splendid
palace, but, though he rode twice round it, he could find
no door. He was considering what he should do next,
when he heard the sound of loud snoring, which seemed
to come from his feet. Looking down, he beheld an old
man lying at the bottom of a deep pit, just outside the
walls, with a lantern by his side.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps <em>he</em> may be able to give me some counsel,&rsquo;
thought the king; and, with some difficulty, he scrambled
into the pit and laid his hand on the shoulder of the
sleeper.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you a bird or a snake that you can enter here?&rsquo;
asked the old man, awakening with a start. But the king
answered that he was a mere mortal, and that he sought
Zoulvisia.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Zoulvisia? The world&rsquo;s curse?&rsquo; replied he, gnashing
his teeth. &lsquo;Out of all the thousands she has slain I am
the only one who has escaped, though why she spared
me only to condemn me to this living death I cannot
guess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Help me if you can,&rsquo; said the king. And he told the
old man his story, to which he listened intently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take heed then to my counsel,&rsquo; answered the old man.
&lsquo;Know that every day at sunrise Zoulvisia dresses herself
in her jacket of pearls, and mounts the steps of her crystal
watch-tower. From there she can see all over her lands,
and behold the entrance of either man or demon. If
so much as one is detected she utters such fearful cries
that those who hear her die of fright. But hide yourself
in a cave that lies near the foot of the tower, and plant
a forked stick in front of it; then, when she has uttered
her third cry, go forth boldly, and look up at the
tower. And go without fear, for you will have broken
her power.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Word for word the king did as the old man had bidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
him, and when he stepped forth from the cave, their eyes
met.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have conquered me,&rsquo; said Zoulvisia, &lsquo;and are
worthy to be my husband, for you are the first man who
has not died at the sound of my voice!&rsquo; And letting down
her golden hair, she drew up the king to the summit of
the tower as with a rope. Then she led him into the hall
of audience, and presented him to her household.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ask of me what you will, and I will grant it to you,&rsquo;
whispered Zoulvisia with a smile, as they sat together on
a mossy bank by the stream. And the king prayed her
to set free the old man to whom he owed his life, and to
send him back to his own country.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>&lsquo;I have finished with hunting, and with riding about
my lands,&rsquo; said Zoulvisia, the day that they were married.
&lsquo;The care of providing for us all belongs henceforth to
you.&rsquo; And turning to her attendants, she bade them bring
the horse of fire before her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is your master, O my steed of flame,&rsquo; cried she;
&lsquo;and you will serve him as you have served me.&rsquo; And
kissing him between his eyes, she placed the bridle in the
hand of her husband.</p>

<p>The horse looked for a moment at the young man,
and then bent his head, while the king patted his neck
and smoothed his tail, till they felt themselves old friends.
After this he mounted to do Zoulvisia&rsquo;s bidding, but before
he started she gave him a case of pearls containing one
of her hairs, which he tucked into the breast of his
coat.</p>

<p>He rode along for some time, without seeing any
game to bring home for dinner. Suddenly a fine stag
started up almost under his feet, and he at once gave
chase. On they sped, but the stag twisted and turned
so that the king had no chance of a shot till they reached
a broad river, when the animal jumped in and swam
across. The king fitted his cross-bow with a bolt, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
took aim, but though he succeeded in wounding the stag,
it contrived to gain the opposite bank, and in his excitement
he never observed that the case of pearls had fallen into
the water.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The stream, though deep, was likewise rapid, and the
box was swirled along miles, and miles, and miles, till it
was washed up in quite another country. Here it was
picked up by one of the water-carriers belonging to the
palace, who showed it to the king. The workmanship of
the case was so curious, and the pearls so rare, that the
king could not make up his mind to part with it, but he
gave the man a good price, and sent him away. Then,
summoning his chamberlain, he bade him find out its
history in three days, or lose his head.</p>

<p>But the answer to the riddle, which puzzled all the
magicians and wise men, was given by an old woman,
who came up to the palace and told the chamberlain
that, for two handfuls of gold, she would reveal the
mystery.</p>

<p>Of course the chamberlain gladly gave her what she
asked, and in return she informed him that the case and
the hair belonged to Zoulvisia.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bring her hither, old crone, and you shall have gold
enough to stand up in,&rsquo; said the chamberlain. And the
old woman answered that she would try what she could
do.</p>

<p>She went back to her hut in the middle of the
forest, and standing in the doorway, whistled softly.
Soon the dead leaves on the ground began to move and
to rustle, and from underneath them there came a long
train of serpents. They wriggled to the feet of the witch,
who stooped down and patted their heads, and gave each
one some milk in a red earthen basin. When they had
all finished, she whistled again, and bade two or three
coil themselves round her arms and neck, while she
turned one into a cane and another into a whip. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
she took a stick, and on the river bank changed it into a
raft, and seating herself comfortably, she pushed off into
the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>All that day she floated, and all the next night, and
towards sunset the following evening she found herself
close to Zoulvisia&rsquo;s garden, just at the moment that the
king, on the horse of flame, was returning from hunting.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he asked in surprise; for old women
travelling on rafts were not common in that country.
&lsquo;Who are you, and why have you come here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am a poor pilgrim, my son,&rsquo; answered she, &lsquo;and
having missed the caravan, I have wandered foodless for
many days through the desert, till at length I reached the
river. There I found this tiny raft, and to it I committed
myself, not knowing if I should live or die. But since
you have found me, give me, I pray you, bread to eat,
and let me lie this night by the dog who guards your
door!&rsquo;</p>

<p>This piteous tale touched the heart of the young man,
and he promised that he would bring her food, and that
she should pass the night in his palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But mount behind me, good woman,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;for
you have walked far, and it is still a long way to the palace.&rsquo;
And as he spoke he bent down to help her, but the
horse swerved on one side.</p>

<p>And so it happened twice and thrice, and the old witch
guessed the reason, though the king did not.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fear to fall off,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but as your kind heart
pities my sorrows, ride slowly, and lame as I am, I think
I can manage to keep up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the door he bade the witch to rest herself, and he
would fetch her all she needed. But Zoulvisia his wife
grew pale when she heard whom he had brought, and
besought him to feed the old woman and send her away,
as she would cause mischief to befall them.</p>

<p>The king laughed at her fears, and answered lightly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
&lsquo;Why, one would think she was a witch to hear you
talk! And even if she were, what harm could she do to
us?&rsquo; And calling to the maidens he bade them carry her
food, and to let her sleep in their chamber.</p>

<p>Now the old woman was very cunning, and kept the
maidens awake half the night with all kinds of strange
stories. Indeed, the next morning, while they were
dressing their mistress, one of them suddenly broke into
a laugh, in which the others joined her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the matter with you?&rsquo; asked Zoulvisia.
And the maid answered that she was thinking of a droll
adventure told them the evening before by the new-comer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And, oh, madam!&rsquo; cried the girl, &lsquo;it may be that
she is a witch, as they say; but I am sure she never would
work a spell to harm a fly! And as for her tales, they
would pass many a dull hour for you, when my lord was
absent!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, in an evil hour, Zoulvisia consented that the crone
should be brought to her, and from that moment the two
were hardly ever apart.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>One day the witch began to talk about the young king,
and to declare that in all the lands she had visited she had
seen none like him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was so clever of him to guess your secret so as to
win your heart,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;And of course he told you
his, in return?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he has got any,&rsquo; returned Zoulvisia.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not got any secrets?&rsquo; cried the old woman scornfully.
&lsquo;That is nonsense! Every man has a secret,
which he always tells to the woman he loves. And
if he has not told it to <em>you</em>, it is that he does not love
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/ofb41.jpg" width="373" height="600"
alt="The witch and her snakes" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>These words troubled Zoulvisia mightily, though she
would not confess it to the witch. But the next time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
she found herself alone with her husband, she began to
coax him to tell her in what lay the secret of his strength.
For a long while he put her off with caresses, but when
she would be no longer denied, he answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is my sabre that gives me strength, and day and
night it lies by my side. But now that I have told you,
swear upon this ring, that I will give you in exchange for
yours, that you will reveal it to nobody.&rsquo; And Zoulvisia
swore; and instantly hastened to betray the great news
to the old woman.</p>

<p>Four nights later, when all the world was asleep, the
witch softly crept into the king&rsquo;s chamber and took the
sabre from his side as he lay sleeping. Then, opening
her lattice, she flew on to the terrace and dropped the
sword into the river.</p>

<p>The next morning everyone was surprised because
the king did not, as usual, rise early and go off to hunt.
The attendants listened at the keyhole and heard the
sound of heavy breathing, but none dared enter, till Zoulvisia
pushed past. And what a sight met their gaze!
There lay the king almost dead, with foam on his mouth,
and eyes that were already closed. They wept, and they
cried to him, but no answer came.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shriek broke from those who stood hindmost,
and in strode the witch, with serpents round her
neck and arms and hair. At a sign from her they flung
themselves with a hiss upon the maidens, whose flesh
was pierced with their poisonous fangs. Then turning
to Zoulvisia, she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I give you your choice&mdash;will you come with me, or
shall the serpents slay you also?&rsquo; And as the terrified
girl stared at her, unable to utter one word, she seized
her by the arm and led her to the place where the raft
was hidden among the rushes. When they were both
on board she took the oars, and they floated down the
stream till they had reached the neighbouring country,
where Zoulvisia was sold for a sack of gold to the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
Now, since the young man had entered the three huts
on his way through the forest, not a morning had passed
without the sons of the three fairies examining the scissors,
the razor and the mirror, which the young king had left
them. Hitherto the surfaces of all three things had been
bright and undimmed, but on this particular morning,
when they took them out as usual, drops of blood stood
on the razor and the scissors, while the little mirror was
clouded over.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Something terrible must have happened to our little
brother,&rsquo; they whispered to each other, with awestruck
faces; &lsquo;we must hasten to his rescue ere it be too late.&rsquo;
And putting on their magic slippers they started for the
palace.</p>

<p>The servants greeted them eagerly, ready to pour
forth all they knew, but that was not much; only that
the sabre had vanished, none knew where. The new-comers
passed the whole of the day in searching for it,
but it could not be found, and when night closed in, they
were very tired and hungry. But how were they to get
food? The king had not hunted that day, and there was
nothing for them to eat. The little men were in despair,
when a ray of the moon suddenly lit up the river beneath
the walls.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How stupid! Of course there are fish to catch,&rsquo;
cried they; and running down to the bank they soon
succeeded in landing some fine fish, which they cooked
on the spot. Then they felt better, and began to look
about them.</p>

<p>Further out, in the middle of the stream, there was
a strange splashing, and by-and-by the body of a huge
fish appeared, turning and twisting as if in pain. The
eyes of all the brothers were fixed on the spot, when the
fish leapt in the air, and a bright gleam flashed through
the night. &lsquo;The sabre!&rsquo; they shouted, and plunged into
the stream, and with a sharp tug, pulled out the sword,
while the fish lay on the water, exhausted by its struggles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
Swimming back with the sabre to land, they carefully
dried it in their coats, and then carried it to the palace
and placed it on the king&rsquo;s pillow. In an instant colour
came back to the waxen face, and the hollow cheeks filled
out. The king sat up, and opening his eyes he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where is Zoulvisia?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is what we do not know,&rsquo; answered the little
men; &lsquo;but now that you are saved you will soon find
out.&rsquo; And they told him what had happened since
Zoulvisia had betrayed his secret to the witch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me go to my horse,&rsquo; was all he said. But when
he entered the stable he could have wept at the sight of
his favourite steed, which was nearly in as sad a plight
as his master had been. Languidly he turned his head
as the door swung back on its hinges, but when he beheld
the king he rose up, and rubbed his head against
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my poor horse! How much cleverer were you
than I! If I had acted like you I should never have
lost Zoulvisia; but we will seek her together, you and I.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>For a long while the king and his horse followed the
course of the stream, but nowhere could he learn anything
of Zoulvisia. At length, one evening, they both
stopped to rest by a cottage not far from a great city,
and as the king was lying outstretched on the grass, lazily
watching his horse cropping the short turf, an old woman
came out with a wooden bowl of fresh milk, which she
offered him.</p>

<p>He drank it eagerly, for he was very thirsty, and then
laying down the bowl, began to talk to the woman,
who was delighted to have someone to listen to her
conversation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are in luck to have passed this way just now,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;for in five days the king holds his wedding
banquet. Ah! but the bride is unwilling, for all her
blue eyes and her golden hair! And she keeps by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
side a cup of poison, and declares that she will swallow
it rather than become his wife. Yet he is a handsome
man too, and a proper husband for her&mdash;more than she
could have looked for, having come no one knows whither,
and bought from a witch&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king started. Had he found her after all? His
heart beat violently, as if it would choke him; but he
gasped out:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is her name Zoulvisia?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ay, so she says, though the old witch&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;But what
ails you?&rsquo; she broke off, as the young man sprang to his
feet and seized her wrists.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Can you keep a secret?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; answered the old woman again, &lsquo;if I am paid
for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you shall be paid, never fear&mdash;as much as your
heart can desire! Here is a handful of gold: you shall
have as much again if you will do my bidding.&rsquo; The old
crone nodded her head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then go and buy a dress such as ladies wear at court,
and manage to get admitted into the palace, and into the
presence of Zoulvisia. When there, show her this ring,
and after that she will tell you what to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the old woman set off, and clothed herself in a garment
of yellow silk, and wrapped a veil closely round her
head. In this dress she walked boldly up the palace steps
behind some merchants whom the king had sent for to
bring presents for Zoulvisia.</p>

<p>At first the bride would have nothing to say to any of
them; but on perceiving the ring, she suddenly grew as
meek as a lamb. And thanking the merchants for their
trouble, she sent them away, and remained alone with
her visitor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Grandmother,&rsquo; asked Zoulvisia, as soon as the door
was safely shut, &lsquo;where is the owner of this ring?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In my cottage,&rsquo; answered the old woman, &lsquo;waiting for
orders from you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
&lsquo;Tell him to remain there for three days; and now
go to the king of this country, and say that you have
succeeded in bringing me to reason. Then he will let
me alone and will cease to watch me. On the third day
from this I shall be wandering about the garden near
the river, and there your guest will find me. The rest
concerns myself only.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The morning of the third day dawned, and with the
first rays of the sun a bustle began in the palace; for
that evening the king was to marry Zoulvisia. Tents
were being erected of fine scarlet cloth, decked with
wreaths of sweet-smelling white flowers, and in them
the banquet was spread. When all was ready a procession
was formed to fetch the bride, who had been
wandering in the palace gardens since daylight, and
crowds lined the way to see her pass. A glimpse of her
dress of golden gauze might be caught, as she passed from
one flowery thicket to another; then suddenly the multitude
swayed, and shrank back, as a thunderbolt seemed to flash
out of the sky to the place where Zoulvisia was standing.
Ah! but it was no thunderbolt, only the horse of fire! And
when the people looked again, it was bounding away with
two persons on its back.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Zoulvisia and her husband both learnt how to keep
happiness when they had got it; and <em>that</em> is a lesson that
many men and woman never learn at all. And besides,
it is a lesson which nobody can teach, and that every boy
and girl must learn for themselves.</p>

<h2><i>GRASP ALL, LOSE ALL</i></h2>


<p>Once, in former times, there lived in a certain city in
India a poor oil-seller, called D&eacute;na, who never could keep
any money in his pockets; and when this story begins
he had borrowed from a banker, of the name of L&eacute;na,
the sum of one hundred rupees; which, with the interest
L&eacute;na always charged, amounted to a debt of three hundred
rupees. Now D&eacute;na was doing a very bad business,
and had no money with which to pay his debt, so L&eacute;na
was very angry, and used to come round to D&eacute;na&rsquo;s house
every evening and abuse him until the poor man was nearly
worried out of his life. L&eacute;na generally fixed his visit
just when D&eacute;na&rsquo;s wife was cooking the evening meal, and
would make such a scene that the poor oil-seller and his
wife and daughter quite lost their appetites, and could
eat nothing. This went on for some weeks, till, one day,
D&eacute;na said to himself that he could stand it no longer,
and that he had better run away; and, as a man cannot
fly easily with a wife and daughter, he thought he must
leave them behind. So that evening, instead of turning
into his house as usual after his day&rsquo;s work, he just slipped
out of the city without knowing very well where he was
going.</p>

<p>At about ten o&rsquo;clock that night D&eacute;na came to a well
by the wayside, near which grew a giant peepul tree; and,
as he was very tired, he determined to climb it, and
rest for a little before continuing his journey in the
morning. Up he went and curled himself so comfortably
amongst the great branches that, overcome with weariness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
he fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, some spirits, who
roam about such places on certain nights, picked up the
tree and flew away with it to a far-away shore where
no creature lived, and there, long before the sun rose,
they set it down. Just then the oil-seller awoke; but
instead of finding himself in the midst of a forest, he
was amazed to behold nothing but waste shore and wide
sea, and was dumb with horror and astonishment. Whilst
he sat up, trying to collect his senses, he began to catch
sight here and there of twinkling, flashing lights, like little
fires, that moved and sparkled all about, and wondered
what they were. Presently he saw one so close to him
that he reached out his hand and grasped it, and found
that it was a sparkling red stone, scarcely smaller than
a walnut. He opened a corner of his loin-cloth and tied
the stone in it; and by-and-by he got another, and then
a third, and a fourth, all of which he tied up carefully
in his cloth. At last, just as the day was breaking, the
tree rose, and, flying rapidly through the air, was deposited
once more by the well where it had stood the previous
evening.</p>

<p>When D&eacute;na had recovered a little from the fright which
the extraordinary antics of the tree had caused him, he
began to thank Providence that he was alive, and, as his
love of wandering had been quite cured, he made his way
back to the city and to his own house. Here he was met
and soundly scolded by his wife, who assailed him with a
hundred questions and reproaches. As soon as she paused
for breath, D&eacute;na replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have only this one thing to say, just look what I
have got!&rsquo; And, after carefully shutting all the doors, he
opened the corner of his loin-cloth and showed her the
four stones, which glittered and flashed as he turned them
over and over.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; said his wife, &lsquo;the silly pebbles! If it was
something to eat, now, there&rsquo;d be some sense in them;
but what&rsquo;s the good of <em>such</em> things?&rsquo; And she turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
away with a sniff, for it had happened that the night
before, when L&eacute;na had come round as usual to storm at
D&eacute;na, he had been rather disturbed to find that his victim
was from home, and had frightened the poor woman by
his threats. Directly, however, he heard that D&eacute;na had
come back, L&eacute;na appeared in the doorway. For some
minutes he talked to the oil-seller at the top of his voice,
until he was tired, then D&eacute;na said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If your honour would deign to walk into my humble
dwelling, I will speak.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So L&eacute;na walked in, and the other, shutting as before
all the doors, untied the corner of his loin-cloth and showed
him the four great flashing stones.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is all,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I have in the world to set
against my debt, for, as your honour knows, I haven&rsquo;t a
penny, but the stones are pretty!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now L&eacute;na looked and saw at once that these were magnificent
rubies, and his mouth watered for them; but as it
would never do to show what was in his mind, he went
on:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do I care about your stupid stones? It is my
money I want, my lawful debt which you owe me, and I
shall get it out of you yet somehow or another, or it will be
the worst for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To all his reproaches D&eacute;na could answer nothing,
but sat with his hands joined together beseechingly,
asking for patience and pity. At length L&eacute;na pretended
that, rather than have a bad debt on his hand, he would
be at the loss of taking the stones in lieu of his money;
and, whilst D&eacute;na nearly wept with gratitude, he wrote
out a receipt for the three hundred rupees; and, wrapping
the four stones in a cloth, he put them into his bosom, and
went off to his house.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How shall I turn these rubies into money?&rsquo; thought
L&eacute;na, as he walked along; &lsquo;I daren&rsquo;t keep them, for they
are of great value, and if the rajah heard that I had them
he would probably put me into prison on some pretence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
and seize the stones and all else that I have as well. But
what a bargain I have got! Four rubies worth a king&rsquo;s
ransom, for one hundred rupees! Well, well, I must take
heed not to betray my secret.&rsquo; And he went on making
plans. Presently he made up his mind what to do, and,
putting on his cleanest clothes, he set off to the house of
the chief wazir, whose name was Musli, and, after seeking
a private audience, he brought out the four rubies and laid
them before him.</p>

<p>The wazir&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as he beheld the splendid
gems.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fine, indeed,&rsquo; murmured he. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t buy them at
their real value; but, if you like to take it, I will give you
ten thousand rupees for the four.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this the banker consented gratefully; and
handing over the stones in exchange for the rupees, he
hurried home, thanking his stars that he had driven such
a reasonable bargain and obtained such an enormous
profit.</p>

<p>After L&eacute;na had departed the wazir began casting about
in his mind what to do with the gems; and very soon determined
that the best thing to do was to present them to
the rajah, whose name was Kahr&eacute;. Without losing a
moment, he went that very day to the palace, and sought
a private interview with the rajah; and when he found
himself alone with his royal master, he brought the four
jewels and laid them before him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, ho!&rsquo; said the rajah, &lsquo;these are priceless gems, and
you have done well to give them to me. In return I give
you and your heirs the revenues of ten villages.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the wazir was overjoyed at these words, but only
made his deepest obeisance; and, whilst the king put the
rubies into his turban, hurried away beaming with happiness
at the thought that for ten thousand rupees he had
become lord of ten villages. The rajah was also equally
pleased, and strolled off with his new purchases to the
women&rsquo;s quarters and showed them to the queen, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
was nearly out of her mind with delight. Then, as she
turned them over and over in her hands, she said: &lsquo;Ah!
if I had eight more such gems, what a necklace they would
make! Get me eight more of them or I shall die!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Most unreasonable of women,&rsquo; cried the rajah,
&lsquo;where am I to get eight more such jewels as these?
I gave ten villages for them, and yet you are not
satisfied!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; said the rani; &lsquo;do you want me
to die? Surely you can get some more where these came
from?&rsquo; And then she fell to weeping and wailing until the
rajah promised that in the morning he would make arrangements
to get some more such rubies, and that if she would
be patient she should have her desire.</p>

<p>In the morning the rajah sent for the wazir, and said
that he must manage to get eight more rubies like those
he had brought him the day before, &lsquo;and if you don&rsquo;t I
shall hang you,&rsquo; cried the rajah, for he was very cross.
The poor wazir protested in vain that he knew not where
to seek them; his master would not listen to a word he
said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You <em>must</em>,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;the rani shall not die for the want
of a few rubies! Get more where those came from.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The wazir left the palace, much troubled in mind, and
bade his slaves bring L&eacute;na before him. &lsquo;Get me eight
more such rubies as those you brought yesterday,&rsquo; commanded
the wazir, directly the banker was shown into
his presence. &lsquo;Eight more, and be quick, or I am a dead
man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But how can I?&rsquo; wailed L&eacute;na; &lsquo;rubies like those don&rsquo;t
grow upon bushes!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where did you get them from?&rsquo; asked the wazir.</p>

<p>&lsquo;From D&eacute;na, the oil-seller,&rsquo; said the banker.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, send for him and ask him where <em>he</em> got them,&rsquo;
answered the wazir. &lsquo;I am not going to hang for twenty
D&eacute;nas!&rsquo; And more slaves were sent to summon D&eacute;na.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
When D&eacute;na arrived he was closely questioned, and then
all three started to see the rajah, and to him D&eacute;na told the
whole story.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What night was it that you slept in the peepul tree?&rsquo;
demanded the rajah.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remember,&rsquo; said D&eacute;na; &lsquo;but my wife will
know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then D&eacute;na&rsquo;s wife was sent for, and she explained that
it was on the last Sunday of the new moon.</p>

<p>Now everyone knows that it is on the Sunday of the
new moon that spirits have special power to play pranks
upon mortals. So the rajah forbade them all, on pain of
death, to say a word to anyone; and declared that, on
the next Sunday of the new moon, they four&mdash;Kahr&eacute;,
Musli, L&eacute;na and D&eacute;na&mdash;would go and sit in the peepul
tree and see what happened.</p>

<p>The days dragged on to the appointed Sunday, and
that evening the four met secretly, and entered the forest.
They had not far to go before they reached the peepul tree,
into which they climbed as the rajah had planned. At
midnight the tree began to sway, and presently it moved
through the air.</p>

<p>&lsquo;See, sire,&rsquo; whispered D&eacute;na, &lsquo;the tree is flying!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said the rajah, &lsquo;you have told the truth.
Now sit quiet, and we shall see what happens.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Away and away flew the tree with the four men clinging
tightly to its branches, until at last it was set down
by the waste sea-shore where a great wide sea came
tumbling in on a desert beach. Presently, as before,
they began to see little points of light that glistened
like fires all around them. Then D&eacute;na thought to
himself:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think! last time I only took four that came close to
me, and I got rid of all my debt in return. This time I
will take all I can get and be rich!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I got ten thousand rupees for four stones,&rsquo; thought
L&eacute;na, &lsquo;I will gather forty now for myself, and become so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
wealthy that they will probably make me a wazir at
least!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For four stones I received ten villages,&rsquo; Musli was
silently thinking; &lsquo;now I will get stones enough to purchase
a kingdom, become a rajah, and employ wazirs of
my own!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/ofb42.jpg" width="500" height="439"
alt="The tree flies away, stranding the treasure seekers"
title="Suddenly the tree rose up again and flew away" />
</div>

<p>And Kahr&eacute; thought: &lsquo;What is the good of only getting
eight stones? Why, here are enough to make twenty
necklaces; and wealth means power!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Full of avarice and desire, each scrambled down from
the tree, spread his cloth, and darted hither and thither
picking up the precious jewels, looking the while over his
shoulder to see whether his neighbour fared better than
he. So engrossed were they in the business of gathering
wealth that the dawn came upon them unawares; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
suddenly the tree rose up again and flew away, leaving
them upon the sea-shore staring after it, each with his
cloth heavy with priceless jewels.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Morning broke in the city, and great was the consternation
in the palace when the chamberlains declared that
the rajah had gone out the evening before and had not
returned.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;it is all right! Musli wazir will
know where he is, for it was he who was the king&rsquo;s
companion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they went to the wazir&rsquo;s house, and there they
learnt that the wazir had left it the evening before and
had not returned; &lsquo;but,&rsquo; said a servant, &lsquo;L&eacute;na the banker
will know where he is, for it was with him that Musli
went.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they visited the house of L&eacute;na, and there they
learnt that the banker had gone out the evening before,
and that he too had not returned; but the porter told
them that he was accompanied by D&eacute;na the oil-seller, so
he would know where they were.</p>

<p>So they departed to D&eacute;na&rsquo;s house, and D&eacute;na&rsquo;s wife met
them with a torrent of reproaches and wailings, for D&eacute;na
too had gone off the evening before to L&eacute;na&rsquo;s house and
had not returned.</p>

<p>In vain they waited, and searched&mdash;never did any of
the hapless four return to their homes; and the confused
tale which was told by D&eacute;na&rsquo;s wife was the only clue to
their fate.</p>

<p>To this day, in that country, when a greedy man has
overreached himself, and lost all in grasping at too much,
folks say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;All has he lost!&mdash;neither D&eacute;na, nor L&eacute;na, nor Musli,
nor Kahr&eacute; remain.&rsquo; And not five men in a hundred know
how the proverb began, nor what it really signifies.</p>

<h2><i>THE FATE OF THE TURTLE</i></h2>


<p>In a very hot country, far away to the east, was a beautiful
little lake where two wild ducks made their home,
and passed their days swimming and playing in its clear
waters. They had it all to themselves, except for a
turtle, who was many years older than they were, and
had come there before them, and, luckily, instead of
taking a dislike to the turtle, as so often happens when
you have only one person to speak to, they became great
friends, and spent most of the day in each other&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>All went on smoothly and happily till one summer,
when the rains failed and the sun shone so fiercely that
every morning there was a little less water in the lake
and a little more mud on the bank. The water-lilies
around the edge began to droop, and the palms to hang
their heads, and the ducks&rsquo; favourite swimming place,
where they could dive the deepest, to grow shallower and
shallower. At length there came a morning when the
ducks looked at each other uneasily, and before nightfall
they had whispered that if at the end of two days rain
had not come, they must fly away and seek a new home,
for if they stayed in their old one, which they loved so
much, they would certainly die of thirst.</p>

<p>Earnestly they watched the sky for many hours
before they tucked their heads under their wings and
fell asleep from sheer weariness, but not the tiniest
cloud was to be seen covering the stars that shone so
big and brilliant, and hung so low in the heavens that
you felt as if you could touch them. So, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
morning broke, they made up their minds that they
must go and tell the turtle of their plans, and bid him
farewell.</p>

<p>They found him comfortably curled up on a pile of
dead rushes, more than half asleep, for he was old, and
could not venture out in the heat as he once used.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! here you are,&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;I began to wonder if
I was ever going to see you again, for, somehow, though
the lake has grown smaller, I seem to have grown
weaker, and it is lonely spending all day and night by
oneself!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! my friend,&rsquo; answered the elder of the two ducks,
&lsquo;if you have suffered we have suffered also. Besides,
I have something to tell you, that I fear will cause you
greater pain still. If we do not wish to die of thirst
we must leave this place at once, and seek another
where the sun&rsquo;s rays do not come. My heart bleeds
to say this, for there is nothing&mdash;nothing else in the
world&mdash;which would have induced us to separate from
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The turtle was so astonished as well as so distressed at
the duck&rsquo;s speech that for a moment he could find no words
to reply. But when he had forced back his tears, he said
in a shaky voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can you think that I am able to live without you,
when for so long you have been my only friends? If
you leave me, death will speedily put an end to my
grief.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Our</em> sorrow is as great as yours,&rsquo; answered the other
duck, &lsquo;but what can we do? And remember that if we
are not here to drink the water, there will be the more for
you! If it had not been for this terrible misfortune, be
sure that nothing would have parted us from one whom
we love so dearly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; replied the turtle, &lsquo;water is as necessary
to me as to you, and if death stares in your faces, it
stares in mine also. But in the name of all the years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
we have passed together, do not, I beseech you, leave me
to perish here alone! Wherever you may go take me with
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause. The ducks felt wretched at the
thought of abandoning their old comrade, yet, at the same
time, how could they grant his prayer? It seemed quite
impossible, and at length one of them spoke:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, how can I find words to refuse?&rsquo; cried he,
&lsquo;yet how can we do what you ask? Consider that,
like yours, our bodies are heavy and our feet small.
Therefore, how could we walk with you over mountains
and deserts, till we reached a land where the sun&rsquo;s rays
no longer burn? Why, before the day was out we
should all three be dead of fatigue and hunger! No,
our only hope lies in our wings&mdash;and, alas! you cannot
fly!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I cannot fly, of course,&rsquo; answered the turtle, with
a sigh. &lsquo;But you are so clever, and have seen so much
of the world&mdash;surely you can think of some plan?&rsquo;
And he fixed his eyes eagerly on them. Now, when the
ducks saw how ardently the turtle wished to accompany
them their hearts were touched, and making a sign to
their friend that they wished to be alone they swam out
into the lake to consult together. Though he could not
hear what they said, the turtle could watch, and the half-hour
that their talk lasted felt to him like a hundred years.
At length he beheld them returning side by side, and so
great was his anxiety to know his fate he almost died from
excitement before they reached him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We hope we have found a plan that may do for you,&rsquo;
said the big duck gravely, &lsquo;but we must warn you that
it is not without great danger, especially if you are not
careful to follow our directions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How is it possible that I should not follow your directions
when my life and happiness are at stake?&rsquo; asked the
turtle joyfully. &lsquo;Tell me what they are, and I will promise
to obey them gratefully.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; answered the duck, &lsquo;whilst we are carrying
you through the air, in the manner that we have fixed
upon, you must remain as quiet as if you were dead. However
high above the earth you may find yourself, you must
not feel afraid, nor move your feet nor open your mouth.
No matter what you see or hear, it is absolutely needful
for you to be perfectly still, or I cannot answer for the
consequences.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will be absolutely obedient,&rsquo; answered the turtle,
&lsquo;not only on this occasion but during all my life; and once
more I promise faithfully not to move head or foot, to
fear nothing, and never to speak a word during the whole
journey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This being settled, the ducks swam about till they
found, floating in the lake, a good stout stick. This they
tied to their necks with some of the tough water-lily roots,
and returned as quickly as they could to the turtle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the elder duck, pushing the stick gently
towards his friend, &lsquo;take this stick firmly in your mouth,
and do not let it go till we have set you down on
earth again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The turtle did as he was told, and the ducks in their
turn seized the stick by the two ends, spread their wings
and mounted swiftly into the air, the turtle hanging between
them.</p>

<p>For a while all went well. They swept across valleys,
over great mountains, above ruined cities, but no lake
was to be seen anywhere. Still, the turtle had faith in
his friends, and bravely hung on to the stick.</p>

<p>At length they saw in the distance a small village, and
very soon they were passing over the roofs of the houses.
The people were so astonished at the strange sight, that
they all&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;ran out to see it,
and cried to each other:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look! look! behold a miracle! Two ducks supporting
a turtle! Was ever such a thing known before!&rsquo;
Indeed, so great was the surprise that men left their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
ploughing and women their weaving in order to add their
voices to their friends&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The ducks flew steadily on, heeding nothing of the
commotion below; but not so the turtle. At first he kept
silence, as he had been bidden to do, but at length the
clamour below proved too much for him, and he began
to think that everyone was envying him the power of travelling
through the air. In an evil moment he forgot the
promises he had made so solemnly, and opened his mouth
to reply, but, before he could utter a word, he was rushing
so swiftly through the air that he quickly became unconscious,
and in this state was dashed to pieces against
the side of a house. Then the ducks let fall after him the
stick that had held up their friend, and which was of no
further use. Sadly they looked at each other and shook
their heads.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We feared it would end so,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;yet, perhaps, he
was right after all. Certainly this death was better than
the one which awaited him.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>THE SNAKE PRINCE</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived by herself, in a city, an old
woman who was desperately poor. One day she found
that she had only a handful of flour left in the house, and
no money to buy more nor hope of earning it. Carrying
her little brass pot, very sadly she made her way down to
the river to bathe and to obtain some water, thinking afterwards
to come home and to make herself an unleavened
cake of what flour she had left; and after that she did not
know what was to become of her.</p>

<p>Whilst she was bathing she left her little brass pot
on the river bank covered with a cloth, to keep the inside
nice and clean; but when she came up out of the river and
took the cloth off to fill the pot with water, she saw inside
it the glittering folds of a deadly snake. At once she popped
the cloth again into the mouth of the pot and held it there;
and then she said to herself:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, kind death! I will take thee home to my house,
and there I will shake thee out of my pot and thou shalt
bite me and I will die, and then all my troubles will be
ended.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With these sad thoughts in her mind the poor old
woman hurried home, holding her cloth carefully in the
mouth of the pot; and when she got home she shut all
the doors and windows, and took away the cloth, and
turned the pot upside down upon her hearthstone. What
was her surprise to find that, instead of the deadly snake
which she expected to see fall out of it, there fell out with
a rattle and a clang a most magnificent necklace of flashing
jewels!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
For a few minutes she could hardly think or speak,
but stood staring; and then with trembling hands she
picked the necklace up, and folding it in the corner of
her veil, she hurried off to the king&rsquo;s hall of public
audience.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A petition, O king!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;A petition for thy
private ear alone!&rsquo; And when her prayer had been
granted, and she found herself alone with the king, she
shook out her veil at his feet, and there fell from it
in glittering coils the splendid necklace. As soon as the
king saw it he was filled with amazement and delight, and
the more he looked at it the more he felt that he must possess
it at once. So he gave the old woman five hundred
silver pieces for it, and put it straightway into his pocket.
Away she went full of happiness; for the money that the
king had given her was enough to keep her for the rest of
her life.</p>

<p>As soon as he could leave his business the king hurried
off and showed his wife his prize, with which she
was as pleased as he, if not more so; and, as soon as they
had finished admiring the wonderful necklace, they locked
it up in the great chest where the queen&rsquo;s jewellery was
kept, the key of which hung always round the king&rsquo;s
neck.</p>

<p>A short while afterwards, a neighbouring king sent a
message to say that a most lovely girl baby had been
born to him; and he invited his neighbours to come to
a great feast in honour of the occasion. The queen told
her husband that of course they must be present at the
banquet, and she would wear the new necklace which he
had given her. They had only a short time to prepare
for the journey, and at the last moment the king went to
the jewel chest to take out the necklace for his wife to
wear, but he could see no necklace at all, only, in its place,
a fat little boy baby crowing and shouting. The king was
so astonished that he nearly fell backwards, but presently
he found his voice, and called for his wife so loudly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
she came running, thinking that the necklace must at
least have been stolen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here! look!&rsquo; cried the king, &lsquo;haven&rsquo;t we always
longed for a son? And now heaven has sent us
one!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried the queen. &lsquo;Are you
mad?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mad? no, I hope not,&rsquo; shouted the king, dancing in
excitement round the open chest. &lsquo;Come here, and look!
Look what we&rsquo;ve got instead of that necklace!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just then the baby let out a great crow of joy, as though
he would like to jump up and dance with the king; and
the queen gave a cry of surprise, and ran up and looked
into the chest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she gasped, as she looked at the baby, &lsquo;what a
darling! Where could he have come from?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;all I know is that
we locked up a necklace in the chest, and when I unlocked
it just now there was no necklace, but a baby, and as fine
a baby as ever was seen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By this time the queen had the baby in her arms.
&lsquo;Oh, the blessed one!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;fairer ornament for
the bosom of a queen than any necklace that ever was
wrought. Write,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;write to our neighbour
and say that we cannot come to his feast, for we have
a feast of our own, and a baby of our own! Oh, happy
day!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the visit was given up; and, in honour of the new
baby, the bells of the city, and its guns, and its trumpets,
and its people, small and great, had hardly any rest for
a week; there was such a ringing, and banging, and blaring,
and such fireworks, and feasting, and rejoicing, and merry-making,
as had never been seen before.</p>

<p>A few years went by; and, as the king&rsquo;s boy baby
and his neighbour&rsquo;s girl baby grew and throve, the two
kings arranged that as soon as they were old enough
they should marry; and so, with much signing of papers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
and agreements, and wagging of wise heads, and stroking
of grey beards, the compact was made, and signed, and
sealed, and lay waiting for its fulfilment. And this too
came to pass; for, as soon as the prince and princess
were eighteen years of age, the kings agreed that it was
time for the wedding; and the young prince journeyed
away to the neighbouring kingdom for his bride, and
was there married to her with great and renewed rejoicings.</p>

<p>Now, I must tell you that the old woman who had
sold the king the necklace had been called in by him to
be the nurse of the young prince; and although she
loved her charge dearly, and was a most faithful servant,
she could not help talking just a little, and so, by-and-by,
it began to be rumoured that there was some magic about
the young prince&rsquo;s birth; and the rumour of course had
come in due time to the ears of the parents of the
princess. So now that she was going to be the wife of
the prince, her mother (who was curious, as many other
people are) said to her daughter on the eve of the
ceremony:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Remember that the first thing you must do is to
find out what this story is about the prince. And in
order to do it, you must not speak a word to him whatever
he says until he asks you why you are silent; then
you must ask him what the truth is about his magic
birth; and until he tells you, you must not speak to him
again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the princess promised that she would follow her
mother&rsquo;s advice.</p>

<p>Therefore when they were married, and the prince
spoke to his bride, she did not answer him. He could
not think what was the matter, but even about her old
home she would not utter a word. At last he asked why
she would not speak; and then she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me the secret of your birth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the prince was very sad and displeased, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
although she pressed him sorely he would not tell her,
but always reply:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I tell you, you will repent that ever you asked
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For several months they lived together; and it was not
such a happy time for either as it ought to have been, for
the secret was still a secret, and lay between them like a
cloud between the sun and the earth, making what should
be fair, dull and sad.</p>

</div>

<p>At length the prince could bear it no longer; so he said
to his wife one day: &lsquo;At midnight I will tell you my secret
if you still wish it; but you will repent it all your life.&rsquo; However,
the princess was overjoyed that she had succeeded,
and paid no attention to his warnings.</p>

<p>That night the prince ordered horses to be ready for
the princess and himself a little before midnight. He
placed her on one, and mounted the other himself, and
they rode together down to the river to the place where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
the old woman had first found the snake in her brass pot.
There the prince drew rein and said sadly: &lsquo;Do you still
insist that I should tell you my secret?&rsquo; And the princess
answered &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;If I do,&rsquo; answered the prince, &lsquo;remember
that you will regret it all your life.&rsquo; But the princess
only replied &lsquo;Tell me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the prince, &lsquo;know that I am the son of the
king of a far country, but by enchantment I was turned
into a snake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The word &lsquo;snake&rsquo; was hardly out of his lips when he
disappeared, and the princess heard a rustle and saw a
ripple on the water; and in the faint moonlight she beheld
a snake swimming into the river. Soon it disappeared
and she was left alone. In vain she waited with beating
heart for something to happen, and for the prince to come
back to her. Nothing happened and no one came; only
the wind mourned through the trees on the river bank,
and the night birds cried, and a jackal howled in the distance,
and the river flowed black and silent beneath her.</p>

<p>In the morning they found her, weeping and dishevelled,
on the river bank; but no word could they learn
from her or from anyone as to the fate of her husband.
At her wish they built on the river bank a little house of
black stone; and there she lived in mourning, with a few
servants and guards to watch over her.</p>

<p>A long, long time passed by, and still the princess lived
in mourning for her prince, and saw no one, and went
nowhere away from her house on the river bank and
the garden that surrounded it. One morning, when she
woke up, she found a stain of fresh mud upon the carpet.
She sent for the guards, who watched outside the house
day and night, and asked them who had entered her room
while she was asleep. They declared that no one <em>could</em>
have entered, for they kept such careful watch that not
even a bird could fly in without their knowledge; but none
of them could explain the stain of mud. The next morning,
again, the princess found another stain of wet mud,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
and she questioned everyone most carefully; but none
could say how the mud came there. The third night
the princess determined to lie awake herself and watch;
and, for fear that she might fall asleep, she cut her finger
with a penknife and rubbed salt into the cut, that the
pain of it might keep her from sleeping. So she lay awake,
and at midnight she saw a snake come wriggling along
the ground with some mud from the river in its mouth;
and when it came near the bed, it reared up its head and
dropped its muddy head on the bedclothes. She was
very frightened, but tried to control her fear, and called
out:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you, and what do you here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the snake answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am the prince, your husband, and I am come to visit
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the princess began to weep; and the snake
continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas! did I not say that if I told you my secret you
would repent it? and have you not repented?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; cried the poor princess, &lsquo;I have repented
it, and shall repent it all my life! Is there nothing I can
do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the snake answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is one thing, if you dared to do it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only tell me,&rsquo; said the princess, &lsquo;and I will do <em>anything</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; replied the snake, &lsquo;on a certain night you
must put a large bowl of milk and sugar in each of the
four corners of this room. All the snakes in the river
will come out to drink the milk, and the one that leads
the way will be the queen of the snakes. You must
stand in her way at the door, and say: &ldquo;Oh, Queen of
Snakes, Queen of Snakes, give me back my husband!&rdquo;
and perhaps she will do it. But if you are frightened,
and do not stop her, you will never see me again.&rsquo; And
he glided away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
On the night of which the snake had told her, the
princess got four large bowls of milk and sugar, and put
one in each corner of the room, and stood in the doorway
waiting. At midnight there was a great hissing and
rustling from the direction of the river, and presently the
ground appeared to be alive with horrible writhing forms
of snakes, whose eyes glittered and forked tongues
quivered as they moved on in the direction of the
princess&rsquo;s house. Foremost among them was a huge,
repulsive scaly creature that led the dreadful procession.
The guards were so terrified that they all ran away; but
the princess stood in the doorway, as white as death, and
with her hands clasped tight together for fear she should
scream or faint, and fail to do her part. As they came
closer and saw her in the way, all the snakes raised their
horrid heads and swayed them to and fro, and looked at
her with wicked beady eyes, while their breath seemed to
poison the very air. Still the princess stood firm, and,
when the leading snake was within a few feet of her, she
cried: &lsquo;Oh, Queen of Snakes, Queen of Snakes, give me
back my husband!&rsquo; Then all the rustling, writhing crowd
of snakes seemed to whisper to one another &lsquo;Her husband?
her husband?&rsquo; But the queen of snakes moved on until
her head was almost in the princess&rsquo;s face, and her little
eyes seemed to flash fire. And still the princess stood
in the doorway and never moved, but cried again: &lsquo;Oh,
Queen of Snakes, Queen of Snakes, give me back my
husband!&rsquo; Then the queen of snakes replied: &lsquo;To-morrow
you shall have him&mdash;to-morrow!&rsquo; When
she heard these words and knew that she had conquered,
the princess staggered from the door, and sank upon her
bed and fainted. As in a dream, she saw that her room
was full of snakes, all jostling and squabbling over the
bowls of milk until it was finished. And then they went
away.</p>

alt="The princess pleads with the snake queen"
title="&#39;Queen of snakes, give me back my husband&#39;" />
</div>

<p>In the morning the princess was up early, and took
off the mourning dress which she had worn for five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
whole years, and put on gay and beautiful clothes. And
she swept the house and cleaned it, and adorned it with
garlands and nosegays of sweet flowers and ferns, and
prepared it as though she were making ready for her wedding.
And when night fell she lit up the woods and gardens
with lanterns, and spread a table as for a feast, and lit
in the house a thousand wax candles. Then she waited
for her husband, not knowing in what shape he would
appear. And at midnight there came striding from the
river the prince, laughing, but with tears in his eyes; and
she ran to meet him, and threw herself into his arms, crying
and laughing too.</p>

<p>So the prince came home; and the next day they two
went back to the palace, and the old king wept with joy
to see them. And the bells, so long silent, were set
a-ringing again, and the guns firing, and the trumpets blaring,
and there was fresh feasting and rejoicing.</p>

<p>And the old woman who had been the prince&rsquo;s nurse
became nurse to the prince&rsquo;s children&mdash;at least she was
called so; though she was far too old to do anything for
them but love them. Yet she still thought that she was
useful, and knew that she was happy. And happy,
indeed, were the prince and princess, who in due time
became king and queen, and lived and ruled long and
prosperously.</p>

<h2><i>THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS
IN THE FOREST</i></h2>


<p>There were, once upon a time, a king and queen of
Denmark who had an only son, a handsome and clever
lad. When he was eighteen, his father, the old king, fell
very ill, and there was no hope that he would ever get
well again. The queen and the prince were very unhappy,
for they loved him dearly; but though they did all they
could, he only grew worse and worse, and, one day, when
the summer had come and the birds were singing, he raised
his head and, taking a long look out of the window, fell
back dead.</p>

<p>During many weeks the queen could hardly eat or
sleep, so sorely did she grieve for him, and the prince
feared that she would die also if she went on weeping;
so he begged her to go with him to a beautiful place
that he knew of on the other side of the forest, and
after some time she consented. The prince was overjoyed,
and arranged that they should set off early next
morning.</p>

<p>They travelled all day, only stopping now and then to
rest, and already the queen began to be better and to take
a little interest in the things she saw. Just as the evening
was coming on they entered the forest. Here it was quite
dark, for the trees grew so close together that the sun could
not shine through them, and very soon they lost the path,
and wandered helplessly about wondering what they should
do.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If we sleep in this dreadful place,&rsquo; said the queen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
who was tired and frightened, &lsquo;the wild beasts will eat
us.&rsquo; And she began to cry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cheer up, mother,&rsquo; answered her son, &lsquo;I have a feeling
that luck is coming to us.&rsquo; And at the next turning they
came to a little house, in the window of which a light was
burning.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?&rsquo; cried the prince. &lsquo;Stay here a
moment and I will go and see if I can get food and shelter
for the night.&rsquo; And away he ran as fast as he could go,
for by this time they were very hungry, as they had brought
very little food with them and had eaten up every scrap!
When one takes a long journey on foot one does not like
to have too much to carry.</p>

<p>The prince entered the house and looked about him,
going from one room to the other, but seeing nobody and
finding nothing to eat. At last, as he was going sorrowfully
away, he caught sight of a sword and shirt of mail
hanging on the wall in an inner room, with a piece of paper
fastened under them. On the paper was some writing,
which said that whoever wore the coat and carried the sword
would be safe from all danger.</p>

<p>The prince was so delighted at the sight that he forgot
how hungry he was, and instantly slipped on the coat of
chain armour under his tunic, and hid the sword under his
cloak, for he did not mean to say anything about what
he had found. Then he went back to his mother, who was
waiting impatiently for him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What have you been doing all this time?&rsquo; she asked
angrily. &lsquo;I thought you had been killed by robbers!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, just looking round,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;but though I
searched everywhere I could find nothing to eat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am very much afraid that it is a robbers&rsquo; den,&rsquo; said
the queen. &lsquo;We had better go on, hungry though we
are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t; but still, we had better not stay here,&rsquo; replied
the prince, &lsquo;especially as there is nothing to eat. Perhaps
we shall find another house.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
They went on for some time, until, sure enough, they
came to another house, which also had a light in the
window.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go in here,&rsquo; said the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no; I am afraid!&rsquo; cried the queen. &lsquo;We shall
be attacked and killed! It is a robbers&rsquo; den: I am sure
it is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, it looks like it; but we can&rsquo;t help that,&rsquo; said her son.
&lsquo;We have had nothing to eat for hours, and I&rsquo;m nearly as
tired as you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor queen was, indeed, quite worn out; she could
hardly stand for fatigue, and in spite of her terror was half
anxious to be persuaded.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And there&rsquo;s going to be a storm,&rsquo; added the prince; who
feared nothing now that he had the sword.</p>

<p>So they went into the house, where they found nobody.
In the first room stood a table laid for a meal, with all
sorts of good things to eat and drink, though some of the
dishes were empty.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, this looks nice,&rsquo; said the prince, sitting down
and helping himself to some delicious strawberries piled
on a golden dish, and some iced lemonade. Never had
anything tasted so nice; but, all the same, it <em>was</em> a robbers&rsquo;
den they had come to, and the robbers, who had only just
dined, had gone out into the forest to see whom they could
rob.</p>

<p>When the queen and the prince could eat no more
they remembered that they were very tired, and the prince
looked about till he discovered a comfortable bed, with
silken sheets, standing in the next room.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You get into bed, mother,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll lie down
by the side. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed; you can sleep quite safely
till the morning.&rsquo; And he lay down with his sword in
his hand, and kept watch until the day began to break;
then the queen woke up and said she was quite rested and
ready to start again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;First I&rsquo;ll go out into the forest and see if I can find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
our road,&rsquo; said the prince. &lsquo;And while I&rsquo;m gone you light
the fire and make some coffee. We must eat a good breakfast
before we start.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<a name="robber_chief" id="robber_chief"></a>
<img src="images/ofb45.jpg" width="389" height="500"
alt="The robber-chief catches the queen" />
</div>

<p>And he ran off into the wood.</p>

<p>After he had gone the queen lit the fire, and then thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
she would like to see what was in the other rooms; so she
went from one to another, and presently came to one that
was very prettily furnished, with lovely pictures on the
walls, and pale blue curtains and soft yellow cushions and
comfortable easy chairs. As she was looking at all
these things, suddenly a trap-door opened in the floor,
and the robber-chief came out of the hole and seized her
ankles. The queen almost died of fright, and shrieked
loudly, then fell on her knees and begged him to spare
her life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you will promise me two things,&rsquo; he replied;
&lsquo;first that you will take me home to your country and
let me be crowned king instead of your son; and secondly,
that you will kill him in case he should try to take the
throne from me&mdash;if you will not agree to this I shall kill
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kill my own son!&rsquo; gasped the queen, staring at him
in horror.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You need not do that exactly,&rsquo; said the robber. &lsquo;When
he returns, just lie on the bed and say that you have been
taken ill, and add that you have dreamed that in a forest,
a mile away, there are some beautiful apples. If you could
only get some of these you would be well again, but if not
you will die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The queen shuddered as she listened. She was fond
of her son, but she was a terrible coward; and so in the
end she agreed, hoping that something would occur to save
the prince. She had hardly given her promise when a step
was heard, and the robber hastily hid himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, mother,&rsquo; cried the prince as he entered, &lsquo;I have
been through the forest and found the road, so we will start
directly we have had some breakfast.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I feel so ill!&rsquo; said the queen. &lsquo;I could not walk
a single step; and there is only one thing that will cure
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; asked the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dreamed,&rsquo; answered the queen, in a faint voice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
&lsquo;that, a mile away, there is a forest where the most beautiful
apples grow, and if I could have some of them I should
soon be well again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! but dreams don&rsquo;t mean anything,&rsquo; said the prince.
&lsquo;There is a magician who lives near here. I&rsquo;ll go to him
and ask for a spell to cure you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dreams always mean something,&rsquo; said the queen,
shaking her head. &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t get any apples I shall die.&rsquo;
She did not know why the robber wanted to send the prince
to this particular forest, but as a matter of fact it was full
of wild animals who would tear to pieces any traveller who
entered it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go,&rsquo; answered the prince. &lsquo;But I really
must have some breakfast first; I shall walk all the
faster.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you do not hurry you will find me dead when you
come back,&rsquo; murmured the queen fretfully. She thought
her son was not nearly anxious enough about her, and
by this time she had begun to believe that she really was
as ill as she had said.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>When the prince had eaten and drunk, he set off, and
soon came to a forest, and sure enough it was full of lions
and tigers, and bears and wolves, who came rushing towards
him; but instead of springing on him and tearing him to
pieces, they lay down on the ground and licked his hands.
He speedily found the tree with the apples which his mother
wanted, but the branches were so high he could not reach
them, and there was no way of climbing up the smooth
trunk.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is no use after all, I can&rsquo;t get up there,&rsquo; he said to
himself. &lsquo;What am I to do now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But, as he turned away, his sword chanced to touch the
tree, and immediately two apples fell down. He picked
them up joyfully, and was going away when a little dog
came out of a hill close by, and running up to him, began
tugging at his clothes and whining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
&lsquo;What do you want, little dog?&rsquo; asked the prince, stooping
down to pat his soft black head.</p>

<p>The dog ran to a hole that was in the hill and sat there
looking out, as much as to say: &lsquo;Come along in with
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may as well go and see what is in there,&rsquo; thought
the prince, and he went over to the hill. But the
hole was so small that he could not get through it,
so he thrust his sword into it, and immediately it became
larger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; he chuckled; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s worth something to have
a sword like that.&rsquo; And he bent down and crept through
the hole.</p>

<p>The first thing he beheld, when he entered a room at
the very end of a dark passage, was a beautiful princess,
who was bound by an iron chain to an iron pillar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What evil fate brought you here?&rsquo; he asked in surprise:
and the lady answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t much use for me to tell you lest my lot becomes
yours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not afraid of that. Tell me who you are and
what has brought you here,&rsquo; begged the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My story is not long,&rsquo; she said, smiling sadly. &lsquo;I am
a princess from Arabia, and twelve robbers who dwell in
this place are fighting among themselves as to which shall
have me to wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shall I save you?&rsquo; asked the prince. And she
answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; but you can&rsquo;t do it. To begin with, how could
you break the chain I am bound with?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy enough,&rsquo; said he, taking out his sword;
and directly it touched the chain the links fell apart and
the princess was free.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said the prince, taking her hand. But she drew
back.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I dare not!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;If we should meet the
robbers in the passage they would kill us both.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span>
&lsquo;Not they!&rsquo; said the prince, brandishing his sword. &lsquo;But
how long have you been here?&rsquo; he added quickly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;About twenty years, I think,&rsquo; said the princess, reckoning
with her fingers.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Twenty years!&rsquo; exclaimed the prince. &lsquo;Then you had
better shut your eyes, for when you have been sitting
there so long it might hurt you to go too suddenly into
the daylight. So you are the Princess of Arabia, whose
beauty is famous throughout all the world! I, too, am
a prince.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you not come back to Arabia and marry me, now
you have saved my life?&rsquo; asked the princess. &lsquo;Even if
my father is living still, he must be old, and after his
death you can be king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the prince, &lsquo;I cannot do that&mdash;I must
live and die in my own country. But at the end of a year
I will follow you and marry you.&rsquo; And that was all he
would say.</p>

<p>Then the princess took a heavy ring from her finger
and put it on his. Her father&rsquo;s and her mother&rsquo;s names
were engraved in it, as well as her own, and she asked
him to keep it as a reminder of his promise.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will die before I part from it,&rsquo; said the prince. &lsquo;And
if at the end of a year I am still living, I will come. I
believe I have heard that at the other side of this forest
there is a port from which ships sail to Arabia. Let us
hasten there at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hand in hand they set off through the forest, and when
they came to the port they found a ship just ready to sail.
The princess said good-bye to the prince, and went on
board the vessel, and when she reached her own country
there were great rejoicings, for her parents had never
expected to see her again. She told them how a prince had
saved her from the robbers, and was coming in a year&rsquo;s
time to marry her, and they were greatly pleased.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All the same,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;I wish he were here now.
A year is a long time.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
When the princess was no longer before his eyes, the
prince recollected why he had entered the forest, and made
all the haste he could back to the robbers&rsquo; home.</p>

<p>The robber-chief could smell the apples from afar, for
he had a nose like an ogre, and he said to the queen:</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a strange fellow! If he had gone into the forest
the wild beasts must have eaten him unless he has a powerful
charm to protect him. If that is so we must get it
away from him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, he has nothing,&rsquo; answered the queen, who was quite
fascinated by the robber.</p>

<p>But the robber did not believe her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We must think of a way to get it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;When
he comes in say you are well again, and have some food
ready for him. Then, whilst he is eating, tell him you
dreamed that he was attacked by wild beasts, and ask
him how he managed to escape from them. After he
has told you I can easily find a way to take his charm
from him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after the prince came in.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How are you, mother!&rsquo; he said gaily. &lsquo;Here are your
apples. Now you will soon be well again, and ready to
come away with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am better already,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;And see, your
dinner is all hot for you, eat it up, and then we will
start.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whilst he was eating she said to him: &lsquo;I had a horrible
dream while you were away. I saw you in a forest full
of wild animals, and they were running round you and
growling fiercely. How did you manage to escape from
them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, it was only a dream!&rsquo; laughed the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But <em>my</em> dreams are always true,&rsquo; said his mother. &lsquo;Tell
me how it was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince wondered for some time whether he should
tell her or not, but at last he decided to let her into the
secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
&lsquo;One should tell one&rsquo;s mother everything,&rsquo; he thought.
And he told her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;See, mother, here are a sword and a mail shirt which
I found in the first house we entered in the forest, and as
long as I carry them nothing can hurt me. That is what
saved me from the wild beasts.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can I be thankful enough!&rsquo; exclaimed the queen.
And directly the prince&rsquo;s back was turned, she hurried to
tell the robber.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The robber, as soon as he heard the news, made a sleeping-draught,
and bade the queen give it to her son before he
went to bed that night.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as the prince began to get
sleepy, the queen handed him the cup containing the
draught.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Drink this, to please me,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It will do you
good after all you&rsquo;ve gone through, and make you sleep
well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What an odd taste it has!&rsquo; murmured the prince as he
drank it.</p>

<p>Immediately he fell asleep; and the robber came in and
took away his sword and shirt of mail.</p>

<p>&lsquo;These things belong to my brother,&rsquo; he said. After he
had got them both in his hand the robber woke him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am the master now,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Choose one of two
things&mdash;either you must die, or your eyes will be put out,
and you will be sent back to the forest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince&rsquo;s blood grew cold at these words. Then a
thought struck him, and he turned to his mother: &lsquo;Is this
<em>your</em> doing?&rsquo; he asked sternly. And though she burst
into tears and denied it, the prince knew she was not telling
the truth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;&ldquo;whilst there is life there is hope.&rdquo; I
will go back to the forest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the robber put out his eyes, gave him a stick,
and some food and drink, and drove him into the forest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
hoping that the wild beasts would kill him, as he no longer
had the sword and shirt to protect him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said to the queen, &lsquo;we will return to your
country.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The next day they set sail, and as soon as they
reached home, they were married, and the robber became
king.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the poor prince was wandering about in
the forest, hoping to find someone who would help him,
and perhaps take him into service, for now he had no
money and no home. It so happened that there had
been a great hunt in the forest, and the wild beasts had
all fled before the hunters and were hiding, so nothing
did him any harm. At last one day, just when his food
was all gone and he had made up his mind that he must
surely die of hunger, he came to the port whence the
ships sailed for Arabia. One vessel was just ready to
start, and the captain was going on board when he saw
the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, here is a poor blind fellow!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;No doubt
that is the work of the robbers. Let us take him to Arabia
with us. Would you like to come, my good man?&rsquo; he asked
the prince.</p>

<p>Oh, how glad he was to hear someone speak kindly to
him again! And he answered that he would, and the
sailors helped him to climb up the side of the ship. When
they got to Arabia the captain took him to the public baths,
and ordered one of the slaves to wash him. Whilst he
was being washed the princess&rsquo;s ring slipped off his finger
and was afterwards found by the slave who cleaned out
the bath. The man showed it to a friend of his who lived
at the palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, it is the princess&rsquo;s ring!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Where did it
come from?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It fell off a blind man&rsquo;s finger,&rsquo; said the slave. &lsquo;He
must have stolen it; but I dare say you will be able to return
it to the princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
So that evening the man took the ring to the palace
and gave it to his daughter, who was the princess&rsquo;s favourite
slave, and the girl gave it to her mistress. When the
princess saw it she uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is the ring I gave my betrothed!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Take
me to him at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bath-keeper thought it strange that the princess
should be betrothed to a blind beggar, but he did as she
bade him, and when she saw the prince she cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;At last you have come! The year is over, and I thought
you were dead. Now we will be married immediately.&rsquo;
And she went home and told the king that he was to send
an escort to bring her betrothed to the palace. Naturally
the king was rather surprised at the sudden arrival of the
prince; but when he heard that he was blind he was very
much annoyed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot have a blind person to succeed me,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;It is perfectly absurd!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the princess had had her own way all her life, and
in the end the king gave way as he had always done. The
prince was taken to the palace with much ceremony and
splendour; but in spite of this the king was not contented.
Still, it could not be helped, and really it was time the princess
was married, though she looked as young as ever.
There had been hundreds of knights and princes who had
begged her to bestow her hand upon them, but she would
have nothing to do with anyone; and now she had taken
it into her head to marry this blind prince, and nobody else
would she have.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>One evening, as it was fine, the prince and princess went
into the garden, and sat down under a tree.</p>

<p>Two ravens were perched on a bush near by, and the
prince, who could understand bird language, heard one
of them say: &lsquo;Do you know that it is Midsummer-eve
to-night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
&lsquo;And do you know that part of the garden which is known
as the Queen&rsquo;s Bed?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps you don&rsquo;t know this, that whoever has
bad eyes, or no eyes at all, should bathe his eye-sockets
in the dew that falls there to-night, because then he will
get his sight back. Only he must do it between twelve
and one o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That was good news for the prince and princess to hear,
and the young man begged the princess to lead him to
the place called the Queen&rsquo;s Bed, which was the little
plot of grass where the queen used often to lie down
and take her midday nap. Then, between twelve and
one o&rsquo;clock, he bathed his eyes with the dew that was
falling there, and found he could see again as well as
ever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can see you!&rsquo; he said to the princess, gazing at her
as if he had never seen anything before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, go and hang your handkerchief on a bush, and
if I find it at once you <em>must</em> believe me,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>And so she did, and he went straight up to the handkerchief.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed, you can see,&rsquo; cried the princess. &lsquo;To
think that my mother&rsquo;s bed has really given back your
sight!&rsquo; and she went to the bank and sat down again;
and by-and-by, as the day was hot, the princess fell asleep.
As the prince watched her he suddenly saw something
shining on her neck. It was a little golden lamp that
gave out a bright light, and it hung from a golden chain.
The prince thought he would like to examine it more closely,
so he unfastened the chain, but as he did so the lamp fell
to the ground. Before he could pick it up a hawk flew in,
snatched up the little lamp and flew away again with it.
The prince set off in pursuit, and ran on and on without
being able to catch the bird, until at length he had lost
his way. Trying to find it, he wandered on, up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
down, until he came to the forest where he had found
the princess.</p>

<p>Meantime, the princess woke up, and finding herself
alone she set out to look for him. In the end she also
lost her way, and as she was walking about, not knowing
what to do, the robbers captured her and took her back
to the cave from which the prince had rescued her. So
there they were after all their trouble&mdash;no better off than
before!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="hawk_flies" id="hawk_flies"></a>
<img src="images/ofb47.jpg" width="500" height="461"
alt="The hawk flies away with the lamp" />
</div>

<p>The prince wandered on, trying to find his way back
to Arabia, until he chanced one day to meet twelve youths,
walking gaily through the forest, singing and laughing.
&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; he asked. And they told him they
were looking for work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll join you, if I may,&rsquo; said the prince. And they
answered: &lsquo;The more the merrier.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the prince went with them, and they all journeyed
on until they met an old troll.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, my masters?&rsquo; asked the troll.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To seek service,&rsquo; they told him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then come and serve me,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;there will be plenty
to eat and drink, and not much work to do, and if, at the
end of a year, you can answer three questions, I&rsquo;ll give you
each a sack of gold. Otherwise you must be turned into
beasts.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The youths thought this sounded easy enough, so they
went home with the troll to his castle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will find all that you want here,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and
all you need do is to take care of the house, for I am going
away, and shall only return when the year is over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went away, and the young men, left to themselves,
had a fine time of it; for they did no work, and
only amused themselves with singing and drinking.
Every day they found the table laid with good things to
eat and drink, and when they had finished, the plates
and dishes were cleared away by invisible hands. Only
the prince, who was sad for his lost princess, ate and
drank sparingly, and worked hard keeping the house in
order.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat in his own room, he heard the voice
of the old troll beneath his window talking to another
troll.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the year is up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what questions will you ask?&rsquo; inquired the
other.</p>

<p>&lsquo;First I shall ask how long they have been here&mdash;they
don&rsquo;t know, the young fools! Secondly I shall ask what
shines on the roof of the castle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what is that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The lamp that was stolen by me from the princess as
she slept in the garden.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
&lsquo;And what is the third question?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall ask where the food and drink they consume
every day come from. I steal it from the king&rsquo;s table;
but they don&rsquo;t know that.&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The day after, the troll entered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now I shall ask my questions,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;To begin with:
How long have you been here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young men had been so busy drinking and making
merry that they had forgotten all about the agreement, so
they remained silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One week,&rsquo; said one, at last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Two months,&rsquo; guessed another. But the prince answered,
&lsquo;One year.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; replied the troll. But the second question was
more difficult.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it that shines on the roof?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young men guessed and guessed. &lsquo;The sun&mdash;the
moon.&rsquo; But none of them really knew.</p>

<p>&lsquo;May I answer?&rsquo; asked the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, certainly,&rsquo; replied the troll; and the prince
spoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The lamp that you stole from the princess whilst
she was asleep in the garden.&rsquo; And again the troll
nodded.</p>

<p>The third question was harder still.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where does the meat and drink you have had here come
from?&rsquo;</p>

<p>None of the young men could guess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;May I say?&rsquo; asked the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you can,&rsquo; replied the troll.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It comes from the king&rsquo;s table,&rsquo; said the prince.</p>

<p>And that was all. Now they might take the sacks of
gold and go, and the young men went off in such a hurry
that the prince was left behind. Presently, they met an
old man who asked for money.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t any,&rsquo; they answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
So they hurried on, and by-and-by up came the
prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Has your lordship a piece of money for a poor man?&rsquo;
asked the old fellow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the prince, and gave him his whole sackful.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it,&rsquo; said the old man, who was really the
troll they had just left in disguise. &lsquo;But since you&rsquo;re
so generous, here is the princess&rsquo;s lamp, and the princess
herself is in the cave where you found her; but how you&rsquo;re
going to save her again without the magic sword I don&rsquo;t
know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When he heard that, the prince knew where she
was; and that was the beginning of her rescue. So he
disguised himself to look like a peddler and travelled on
until he reached his own city, where his mother, the
queen, and the robber-chief were living. Then he went
in to a goldsmith&rsquo;s shop and ordered a great number
of kitchen pots to be made out of pure gold. That was
not an order the goldsmith had every day, but the
things were ready at last, saucepans and kettles and
gridirons all of pure gold. Then the prince put them in
his basket and went up to the palace, and asked to see
the queen.</p>

<p>Directly she heard about the wonderful gold pots and
pans she came out at once, and began unpacking the basket
and admiring the things. She was so absorbed in them
that the prince soon found an opportunity to steal into
the bedroom and take the sword and shirt which were
hung there, and go back again without his mother having
noticed his absence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The things are all beautiful!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;How much
would you take for them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Name your own price, your majesty,&rsquo; answered the
prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rsquo; said the queen. &lsquo;Wait
till my husband comes back&mdash;men understand such things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
better; and then, as you are a stranger, he would like to
chat with you a little.&rsquo; The prince bowed, and waited
silently in a corner.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Soon after the robber returned.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come and see all these lovely gold saucepans!&rsquo; cried the
queen.</p>

<p>But, as the robber entered the room, the prince
touched him with the magic sword, and he fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, now you know me, mother,&rsquo; the prince said,
taking off his disguise, &lsquo;you had better repent for all
the wrong you have done me, or your life will be short.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, have mercy!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I could not help it. I was
so frightened.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince had mercy. He ordered the wicked king
to be stripped of his fine clothes, and to be driven into
the forest, where the wild beasts tore him to pieces. The
queen he sent to her own country. Then he set off for the
cave where the princess was sitting chained as before, and
with the help of the magic sword he rescued her again
without any difficulty. They soon reached the port and
set sail for Arabia, where they were married; and till they
died, a long while after, they reigned happily over both
countries.</p>

<h2><i>THE CLEVER WEAVER</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time the king of a far country was sitting
on his throne, listening to the complaints of his people,
and judging between them. That morning there had
been fewer cases than usual to deal with, and the king
was about to rise and go into his gardens, when a sudden
stir was heard outside, and the lord high chamberlain
entered, and inquired if his majesty would be graciously
pleased to receive the ambassador of a powerful emperor
who lived in the east, and was greatly feared by the
neighbouring sovereigns. The king, who stood as much
in dread of him as the rest, gave orders that the envoy
should be admitted at once, and that a banquet should
be prepared in his honour. Then he settled himself
again on his throne, wondering what the envoy had to
say.</p>

<p>The envoy said nothing. He advanced to the throne
where the king was awaiting him, and stooping down,
traced on the floor with a rod which he held in his hand
a black circle all round it. Then he sat down on a seat
that was near, and took no further notice of anyone.</p>

<p>The king and his courtiers were equally mystified
and enraged at this strange behaviour, but the envoy sat
as calm and still as an image, and it soon became plain
that they would get no explanation from <em>him</em>. The ministers
were hastily summoned to a council, but not one of
them could throw any light upon the subject. This made
the king more angry than ever, and he told them that unless
before sunset they could find someone capable of solving the
mystery he would hang them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
The king was, as the ministers knew, a man of his
word; and they quickly mapped out the city into districts,
so that they might visit house by house, and question
the occupants as to whether they could fathom the
action of the ambassador. Most of them received no
reply except a puzzled stare; but, luckily, one of them
was more observant than the rest, and on entering an
empty cottage where a swing was swinging of itself, he
began to think it might be worth while for him to see
the owner. Opening a door leading into another room,
he found a second swing, swinging gently like the first,
and from the window he beheld a patch of corn, and a
willow which moved perpetually without any wind, in
order to frighten away the sparrows. Feeling more and
more curious, he descended the stairs and found himself
in a large light workshop in which was seated a weaver
at his loom. But all the weaver did was to guide his
threads, for the machine that he had invented to set in
motion the swings and the willow pole made the loom
work.</p>

<p>When he saw the great wheel standing in the corner,
and had guessed the use of it, the merchant heaved a
sigh of relief. At any rate, if the weaver could not guess
the riddle, he at least might put the minister on the right
track. So without more ado he told the story of the
circle, and ended by declaring that the person who could
explain its meaning should be handsomely rewarded.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come with me at once,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The sun is low in
the heavens, and there is no time to lose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The weaver stood thinking for a moment and then
walked across to a window, outside of which was a hen-coop
with two knuckle-bones lying beside it. These he
picked up, and taking the hen from the coop, he tucked
it under his arm.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am ready,&rsquo; he answered, turning to the minister.</p>

<p>In the hall the king still sat on his throne, and the
envoy on his seat. Signing to the minister to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
where he was, the weaver advanced to the envoy, and
placed the knuckle-bones on the floor beside him. For
answer, the envoy took a handful of millet seed out of
his pocket and scattered it round; upon which the
weaver set down the hen, who ate it up in a moment.
At that the envoy rose without a word, and took his
departure.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left the hall, the king beckoned to the
weaver.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You alone seem to have guessed the riddle,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;and great shall be your reward. But tell me, I pray you,
what it all means?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The meaning, O king,&rsquo; replied the weaver, &lsquo;is this:
The circle drawn by the envoy round your throne is the
message of the emperor, and signifies, &ldquo;If I send an army
and surround your capital, will you lay down your arms?&rdquo;
The knuckle-bones which I placed before him told him,
&ldquo;You are but children in comparison with us. Toys
like these are the only playthings you are fit for.&rdquo; The
millet that he scattered was an emblem of the number
of soldiers that his master can bring into the field; but
by the hen which ate up the seed he understood that one
of our men could destroy a host of theirs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not think,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that the emperor will declare
war.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have saved me and my honour,&rsquo; cried the king,
&lsquo;and wealth and glory shall be heaped upon you. Name
your reward, and you shall have it even to the half of my
kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The small farm outside the city gates, as a marriage
portion for my daughter, is all I ask,&rsquo; answered the weaver,
and it was all he would accept. &lsquo;Only, O king,&rsquo; were his
parting words, &lsquo;I would beg of you to remember that weavers
also are of value to a state, and that they are sometimes
cleverer even than ministers!&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>THE BOY WHO FOUND FEAR AT LAST</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a woman who had one son
whom she loved dearly. The little cottage in which
they dwelt was built on the outskirts of a forest, and as
they had no neighbours, the place was very lonely, and
the boy was kept at home by his mother to bear her
company.</p>

<p>They were sitting together on a winter&rsquo;s evening,
when a storm suddenly sprang up, and the wind blew
the door open. The woman started and shivered, and
glanced over her shoulder as if she half expected to see
some horrible thing behind her. &lsquo;Go and shut the door,&rsquo;
she said hastily to her son, &lsquo;I feel frightened.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Frightened?&rsquo; repeated the boy. &lsquo;What does it feel
like to be frightened?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;just frightened,&rsquo; answered the mother. &lsquo;A
fear of something, you hardly know what, takes hold of
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It must be very odd to feel like that,&rsquo; replied the
boy. &lsquo;I will go through the world and seek fear till I find
it.&rsquo; And the next morning, before his mother was out of
bed, he had left the forest behind him.</p>

<p>After walking for some hours he reached a mountain,
which he began to climb. Near the top, in a wild and
rocky spot, he came upon a band of fierce robbers, sitting
round a fire. The boy, who was cold and tired, was
delighted to see the bright flames, so he went up to them
and said, &lsquo;Good greeting to you, sirs,&rsquo; and wriggled himself
in between the men, till his feet almost touched the
burning logs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
The robbers stopped drinking and eyed him curiously,
and at last the captain spoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No caravan of armed men would dare to come here,
even the very birds shun our camp, and who are you to
venture in so boldly?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I have left my mother&rsquo;s house in search of fear.
Perhaps you can show it to me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fear is wherever <em>we</em> are,&rsquo; answered the captain.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But <em>where</em>?&rsquo; asked the boy, looking round. &lsquo;I see
nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take this pot and some flour and butter and sugar over
to the churchyard which lies down there, and bake us a
cake for supper,&rsquo; replied the robber. And the boy, who
was by this time quite warm, jumped up cheerfully, and
slinging the pot over his arm, ran down the hill.</p>

<p>When he got to the churchyard he collected some sticks
and made a fire; then he filled the pot with water from a
little stream close by, and mixing the flour and butter and
sugar together, he set the cake on to cook. It was not long
before it grew crisp and brown, and then the boy lifted it
from the pot and placed it on a stone, while he put out the
fire. At that moment a hand was stretched from a grave,
and a voice said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that cake for me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you think I am going to give to the dead the food
of the living?&rsquo; replied the boy, with a laugh. And
giving the hand a tap with his spoon, and picking up
the cake, he went up the mountain side, whistling
merrily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, have you found fear?&rsquo; asked the robbers when he
held out the cake to the captain.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;No; was it there?&rsquo; answered the boy. &lsquo;I saw nothing
but a hand which came from a grave, and belonged
to someone who wanted my cake, but I just rapped the
fingers with my spoon, and said it was not for him, and
then the hand vanished. Oh, how nice the fire is!&rsquo; And
he flung himself on his knees before it, and so did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
notice the glances of surprise cast by the robbers at each
other.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is another chance for you,&rsquo; said one at length.
&lsquo;On the other side of the mountain lies a deep pool; go
to that, and perhaps you may meet fear on the way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope so, indeed,&rsquo; answered the boy. And he set out
at once.</p>

<p>He soon beheld the waters of the pool gleaming in the
moonlight, and as he drew near he saw a tall swing standing
just over it, and in the swing a child was seated, weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a strange place for a swing,&rsquo; thought the boy;
&lsquo;but I wonder what he is crying about.&rsquo; And he was
hurrying on towards the child, when a maiden ran up and
spoke to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to lift my little brother from the swing,&rsquo; cried
she, &lsquo;but it is so high above me, that I cannot reach. If
you will get closer to the edge of the pool, and let me mount
on your shoulder, I think I can reach him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Willingly,&rsquo; replied the boy, and in an instant the girl
had climbed to his shoulders. But instead of lifting
the child from the swing, as she could easily have done,
she pressed her feet so firmly on either side of the youth&rsquo;s
neck, that he felt that in another minute he would be
choked, or else fall into the water beneath him. So
gathering up all his strength, he gave a mighty heave,
and threw the girl backwards. As she touched the ground
a bracelet fell from her arm, and this the youth picked
up.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may as well keep it as a remembrance of all the queer
things that have happened to me since I left home,&rsquo; he said
to himself, and turning to look for the child, he saw that
both it and the swing had vanished, and that the first streaks
of dawn were in the sky.</p>

<p>With the bracelet on his arm, the youth started for a
little town which was situated in the plain on the further
side of the mountain, and as, hungry and thirsty, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
entered its principal street, a Jew stopped him. &lsquo;Where
did you get that bracelet?&rsquo; asked the Jew. &lsquo;It belongs
to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, it is mine,&rsquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not. Give it to me at once, or it will be the worse
for you!&rsquo; cried the Jew.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let us go before a judge, and tell him our stories,&rsquo; said
the boy. &lsquo;If he decides in your favour, you shall have it;
if in mine, I will keep it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this the Jew agreed, and the two went together to
the great hall, in which the kadi was administering justice.
He listened very carefully to what each had to say, and then
pronounced his verdict. Neither of the two claimants had
proved his right to the bracelet, therefore it must remain
in the possession of the judge till its fellow was brought
before him.</p>

<p>When they heard this, the Jew and the boy looked at
each other, and their eyes said: &lsquo;Where are we to go to find
the other one?&rsquo; But as they knew there was no use in
disputing the decision, they bowed low and left the hall
of audience.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Wandering he knew not whither, the youth found himself
on the sea-shore. At a little distance was a ship which
had struck on a hidden rock, and was rapidly sinking,
while on deck the crew were gathered, with faces white
as death, shrieking and wringing their hands.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you met with fear?&rsquo; shouted the boy. And the
answer came above the noise of the waves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, help! help! We are drowning!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the boy flung off his clothes, and swam to the
ship, where many hands were held out to draw him on
board.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The ship is tossed hither and thither, and will soon be
sucked down,&rsquo; cried the crew again. &lsquo;Death is very near,
and we are frightened!&rsquo;</p>

alt="The sea-maiden with a wicked face" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Give me a rope,&rsquo; said the boy in reply, and he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>
it, and made it safe round his body at one end, and to
the mast at the other, and sprang into the sea. Down
he went, down, down, down, till at last his feet touched
the bottom, and he stood up and looked about him.
There, sure enough, a sea-maiden with a wicked face
was tugging hard at a chain which she had fastened to
the ship with a grappling iron, and was dragging it bit
by bit beneath the waves. Seizing her arms in both his
hands, he forced her to drop the chain, and the ship
above remaining steady, the sailors were able gently to
float her off the rock. Then taking a rusty knife from
a heap of seaweed at his feet, he cut the rope round his
waist and fastened the sea-maiden firmly to a stone, so
that she could do no more mischief, and bidding her
farewell, he swam back to the beach, where his clothes
were still lying.</p>

<p>The youth dressed himself quickly and walked on
till he came to a beautiful shady garden filled with
flowers, and with a clear little stream running through.
The day was hot, and he was tired, so he entered
the gate, and seated himself under a clump of bushes
covered with sweet-smelling red blossoms, and it was
not long before he fell asleep. Suddenly a rush of
wings and a cool breeze awakened him, and raising his
head cautiously, he saw three doves plunging into the
stream. They splashed joyfully about, and shook themselves,
and then dived to the bottom of a deep pool.
When they appeared again they were no longer three
doves, but three beautiful damsels, bearing between them
a table made of mother of pearl. On this they placed
drinking cups fashioned from pink and green shells, and
one of the maidens filled a cup from a crystal goblet,
and was raising it to her mouth, when her sister stopped
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To whose health do you drink?&rsquo; asked she.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To the youth who prepared the cake, and rapped
my hand with the spoon when I stretched it out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
earth,&rsquo; answered the maiden, &lsquo;and was never afraid as
other men were! But to whose health do you drink?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To the youth on whose shoulders I climbed at the edge
of the pool, and who threw me off with such a jerk, that I
lay unconscious on the ground for hours,&rsquo; replied the second.
&lsquo;But you, my sister,&rsquo; added she, turning to the third girl,
&lsquo;to whom do you drink?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Down in the sea I took hold of a ship and shook it and
pulled it till it would soon have been lost,&rsquo; said she. And
as she spoke she looked quite different from what she had
done with the chain in her hands, seeking to work mischief.
&lsquo;But a youth came, and freed the ship and bound me to
a rock. To his health I drink,&rsquo; and they all three lifted
their cups and drank silently.</p>

<p>As they put their cups down, the youth appeared before
them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here am I, the youth whose health you have drunk;
and now give me the bracelet that matches a jewelled
band which of a surety fell from the arm of one of you.
A Jew tried to take it from me, but I would not let him
have it, and he dragged me before the kadi, who kept
my bracelet till I could show him its fellow. And I
have been wandering hither and thither in search of it,
and that is how I have found myself in such strange
places.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come with us, then,&rsquo; said the maidens, and they led
him down a passage into a hall, out of which opened many
chambers, each one of greater splendour than the last.
From a shelf heaped up with gold and jewels the eldest
sister took a bracelet, which in every way was exactly like
the one which was in the judge&rsquo;s keeping, and fastened it
to the youth&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go at once and show this to the kadi,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and he
will give you the fellow to it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall never forget you,&rsquo; answered the youth, &lsquo;but
it may be long before we meet again, for I shall never
rest till I have found fear.&rsquo; Then he went his way, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
won the bracelet from the kadi. After this, he again set
forth in his quest of fear.</p>

<p>On and on walked the youth, but fear never crossed his
path, and one day he entered a large town, where all the
streets and squares were so full of people, he could hardly
pass between them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why are all these crowds gathered together?&rsquo; he asked
of a man who stood next him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The ruler of this country is dead,&rsquo; was the reply,
&lsquo;and as he had no children, it is needful to choose a
successor. Therefore each morning one of the sacred
pigeons is let loose from the tower yonder, and on whomsoever
the bird shall perch, that man is our king. In a
few minutes the pigeon will fly. Wait and see what happens.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Every eye was fixed on the tall tower which stood in
the centre of the chief square, and the moment that the sun
was seen to stand straight over it, a door was opened and
a beautiful pigeon, gleaming with pink and grey, blue and
green, came rushing through the air. Onward it flew, onward,
onward, till at length it rested on the head of the boy.
Then a great shout arose:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The king! the king!&rsquo; but as he listened to the cries,
a vision, swifter than lightning, flashed across his brain.
He saw himself seated on a throne, spending his life trying,
and never succeeding, to make poor people rich; miserable
people happy; bad people good; never doing anything
he wished to do, not able even to marry the girl that
he loved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; he shrieked, hiding his face in his hands; but
the crowds who heard him thought he was overcome by the
grandeur that awaited him, and paid no heed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, to make quite sure, let fly more pigeons,&rsquo; said they,
but each pigeon followed where the first had led, and the
cries arose louder than ever:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The king! the king!&rsquo; And as the young man heard,
a cold shiver, that he knew not the meaning of, ran through
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
&lsquo;This is fear whom you have so long sought,&rsquo; whispered
a voice, which seemed to reach his ears alone. And the youth
bowed his head as the vision once more flashed before his
eyes, and he accepted his doom, and made ready to pass
his life with fear beside him.</p>

<h2><i>HE WINS WHO WAITS</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there reigned a king who had an only
daughter. The girl had been spoiled by everybody from
her birth, and, besides being beautiful, was clever and
wilful, and when she grew old enough to be married
she refused to have anything to say to the prince whom
her father favoured, but declared she would choose a
husband for herself. By long experience the king knew
that when once she had made up her mind, there was no
use expecting her to change it, so he inquired meekly what
she wished him to do.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Summon all the young men in the kingdom to appear
before me a month from to-day,&rsquo; answered the princess;
&lsquo;and the one to whom I shall give this golden apple shall
be my husband.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, my dear&mdash;&rsquo; began the king, in tones of dismay.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The one to whom I shall give this golden apple shall be
my husband,&rsquo; repeated the princess, in a louder voice than
before. And the king understood the signal, and with a
sigh proceeded to do her bidding.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The young men arrived&mdash;tall and short, dark and fair,
rich and poor. They stood in rows in the great courtyard
in front of the palace, and the princess, clad in robes
of green, with a golden veil flowing behind her, passed
before them all, holding the apple. Once or twice she
stopped and hesitated, but in the end she always passed
on, till she came to a youth near the end of the last row.
There was nothing specially remarkable about him, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
bystanders thought; nothing that was likely to take a
girl&rsquo;s fancy. A hundred others were handsomer, and all
wore finer clothes; but he met the princess&rsquo;s eyes frankly
and with a smile, and she smiled too, and held out the
apple.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is some mistake,&rsquo; cried the king, who had anxiously
watched her progress, and hoped that none of the
candidates would please her. &lsquo;It is impossible that she
can wish to marry the son of a poor widow, who has not a
farthing in the world! Tell her that I will not hear of it,
and that she must go through the rows again and fix upon
someone else&rsquo;; and the princess went through the rows a
second and a third time, and on each occasion she gave
the apple to the widow&rsquo;s son. &lsquo;Well, marry him if you
will,&rsquo; exclaimed the angry king; &lsquo;but at least you shall
not stay here.&rsquo; And the princess answered nothing, but
threw up her head, and taking the widow&rsquo;s son by the hand,
they left the castle.</p>

<p>That evening they were married, and after the ceremony
went back to the house of the bridegroom&rsquo;s mother, which,
in the eyes of the princess, did not look much bigger than a
hen-coop.</p>

<p>The old woman was not at all pleased when her son
entered bringing his bride with him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As if we were not poor enough before,&rsquo; grumbled she.
&lsquo;I dare say this is some fine lady who can do nothing to
earn her living.&rsquo; But the princess stroked her arm, and
said softly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not be vexed, dear mother; I am a famous spinner,
and can sit at my wheel all day without breaking a
thread.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">

<img src="images/ofb50.jpg" width="462" height="700"
alt="The princess gives the apple to the widow&#39;s son"
title="The princess chooses" />
</div>

<p>And she kept her word; but in spite of the efforts of
all three, they became poorer and poorer; and at the end
of six months it was agreed that the husband should go
to the neighbouring town to get work. Here he met a
merchant who was about to start on a long journey with
a train of camels laden with goods of all sorts, and needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
a man to help him. The widow&rsquo;s son begged that he would
take him as a servant, and to this the merchant assented,
giving him his whole year&rsquo;s salary beforehand. The young
man returned home with the news, and next day bade
farewell to his mother and his wife, who were very sad at
parting from him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not forget me while you are absent,&rsquo; whispered the
princess as she flung her arms round his neck; &lsquo;and as you
pass by the well which lies near the city gate, stop and greet
the old man you will find sitting there. Kiss his hand,
and then ask him what counsel he can give you for your
journey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the youth set out, and when he reached the well
where the old man was sitting he asked the questions as
his wife had bidden him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; replied the old man, &lsquo;you have done well to
come to me, and in return remember three things: &ldquo;She
whom the heart loves, is ever the most beautiful.&rdquo; &ldquo;Patience
is the first step on the road to happiness.&rdquo; &ldquo;He
wins who waits.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man thanked him and went on his way. Next
morning early the caravan set out, and before sunset it
had arrived at the first halting place, round some wells,
where another company of merchants had already encamped.
But no rain had fallen for a long while in that
rocky country, and both men and beasts were parched
with thirst. To be sure, there <em>was</em> another well about
half a mile away, where there was always water; but to
get it you had to be lowered deep down, and, besides, no
one who had ever descended that well had been known to
come back.</p>

<p>However, till they could store some water in their
bags of goat-skin, the caravans dared not go further
into the desert, and on the night of the arrival of the
widow&rsquo;s son and his master, the merchants had decided
to offer a large reward to anyone who was brave enough
to go down into the enchanted well and bring some up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
Thus it happened that at sunrise the young man was
aroused from his sleep by a herald making his round
of the camp, proclaiming that every merchant present
would give a thousand piastres to the man who would
risk his life to bring water for themselves and their
camels.</p>

<p>The youth hesitated for a little while when he heard
the proclamation. The story of the well had spread far
and wide, and long ago had reached his ears. The
danger was great, he knew; but then, if he came back
alive, he would be the possessor of eighty thousand
piastres. He turned to the herald who was passing the
tent:</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>I</em> will go,&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What madness!&rsquo; cried his master, who happened to
be standing near. &lsquo;You are too young to throw away
your life like that. Run after the herald and tell him you
take back your offer.&rsquo; But the young man shook his head,
and the merchant saw that it was useless to try and persuade
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it is your own affair,&rsquo; he observed at last. &lsquo;If you
must go, you must. Only, if you ever return, I will give
you a camel&rsquo;s load of goods and my best mule besides.&rsquo;
And touching his turban in token of farewell, he entered
the tent.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so than a crowd of men were seen
pouring out of the camp.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can we thank you!&rsquo; they exclaimed, pressing round
the youth. &lsquo;Our camels as well as ourselves are almost
dead of thirst. See! here is the rope we have brought to
let you down.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, then,&rsquo; answered the youth. And they all set
out.</p>

<p>On reaching the well, the rope was knotted securely
under his arms, a big goat-skin bottle was given him,
and he was gently lowered to the bottom of the pit.
Here a clear stream was bubbling over the rocks, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
stooping down, he was about to drink, when a huge Arab
appeared before him, saying in a loud voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come with me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man rose, never doubting that his last hour
had come; but as he could do nothing, he followed the Arab
into a brilliantly lighted hall, on the further side of the
little river. There his guide sat down, and drawing towards
him two boys, one black and the other white, he said to the
stranger:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have a question to ask you. If you answer it
right, your life shall be spared. If not, your head will
be forfeit, as the head of many another has been before
you. Tell me: which of my two children do I think the
handsomer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The question did not seem a hard one, for while the
white boy was as beautiful a child as ever was seen, his
brother was ugly even for a negro. But, just as the
youth was going to speak, the old man&rsquo;s counsel flashed
into the youth&rsquo;s mind, and he replied hastily: &lsquo;The one
whom we love best is always the handsomest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have saved me!&rsquo; cried the Arab, rising quickly
from his seat, and pressing the young man in his arms.
&lsquo;Ah! if you could only guess what I have suffered from
the stupidity of all the people to whom I have put that
question, and I was condemned by a wicked genius to
remain here until it was answered! But what brought
you to this place, and how can I reward you for what you
have done for me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;By helping me to draw enough water for my caravan
of eighty merchants and their camels, who are dying for
want of it,&rsquo; replied the youth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is easily done,&rsquo; said the Arab. &lsquo;Take these
three apples, and when you have filled your skin, and are
ready to be drawn up, lay one of them on the ground.
Half-way to the earth, let fall another, and at the top,
drop the third. If you follow my directions no harm
will happen to you. And take, besides, these three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
pomegranates, green, red and white. One day you will
find a use for them!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man did as he was told, and stepped out
on the rocky waste, where the merchants were anxiously
awaiting him. Oh, how thirsty they all were! But even
after the camels had drunk, the skin seemed as full as
ever.</p>

<p>Full of gratitude for their deliverance, the merchants
pressed the money into his hands, while his own master
bade him choose what goods he liked, and a mule to carry
them.</p>

<p>So the widow&rsquo;s son was rich at last, and when the merchant
had sold his merchandise, and returned home to
his native city, his servant hired a man by whom he sent
the money and the mule back to his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will send the pomegranates also,&rsquo; thought he &lsquo;for
if I leave them in my turban they may some day fall out,&rsquo;
and he drew them out of his turban. But the fruit had
vanished, and in their places were three precious stones,
green, white and red.</p>

<p>For a long time he remained with the merchant, who
gradually trusted him with all his business, and gave him
a large share of the money he made. When his master
died, the young man wished to return home, but the widow
begged him to stay and help her; and one day he awoke
with a start, to remember that twenty years had passed
since he had gone away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to see my wife,&rsquo; he said next morning to his
mistress. &lsquo;If at any time I can be of use to you, send a
messenger to me; meanwhile, I have told Hassan what to
do.&rsquo; And mounting a camel he set out.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Now, soon after he had taken service with the merchant
a little boy had been born to him, and both the
princess and the old woman toiled hard all day to get
the baby food and clothing. When the money and the
pomegranates arrived there was no need for them to work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
any more, and the princess saw at once that they were
not fruit at all, but precious stones of great value. The
old woman, however, not being accustomed, like her
daughter-in-law, to the sight of jewels, took them only
for common fruit, and wished to give them to the child
to eat. She was very angry when the princess hastily
took them from her and hid them in her dress, while she
went to the market and bought the three finest pomegranates
she could find, which she handed the old woman for
the little boy.</p>

<p>Then she bought beautiful new clothes for all of them,
and when they were dressed they looked as fine as could
be. Next, she took out one of the precious stones which
her husband had sent her, and placed it in a small silver
box. This she wrapped up in a handkerchief embroidered
in gold, and filled the old woman&rsquo;s pockets with gold and
silver pieces.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go, dear mother,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;to the palace, and
present the jewel to the king, and if he asks you what
he can give you in return, tell him that you want a
paper, with his seal attached, proclaiming that no one is
to meddle with anything you may choose to do. Before
you leave the palace distribute the money amongst the
servants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old woman took the box and started for the
palace. No one there had ever seen a ruby of such
beauty, and the most famous jeweller in the town was
summoned to declare its value. But all he could say
was:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If a boy threw a stone into the air with all his might,
and you could pile up gold as high as the flight of the stone,
it would not be sufficient to pay for this ruby.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At these words the king&rsquo;s face fell. Having once seen
the ruby he could not bear to part with it, yet all the money
in his treasury would not be enough to buy it. So for a
little while he remained silent, wondering what offer he
could make the old woman, and at last he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
&lsquo;If I cannot give you its worth in money, is there anything
you will take in exchange?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A paper signed by your hand, and sealed with your
seal, proclaiming that I may do what I will, without let
or hindrance,&rsquo; answered she promptly. And the king,
delighted to have obtained what he coveted at so small
a cost, gave her the paper without delay. Then the old
woman took her leave and returned home.</p>

<p>The fame of this wonderful ruby soon spread far and
wide, and envoys arrived at the little house to know if
there were more stones to sell. Each king was so
anxious to gain possession of the treasure that he bade
his messenger outbid all the rest, and so the princess
sold the two remaining stones for a sum of money so
large that if the gold pieces had been spread out they
would have reached from here to the moon. The first
thing she did was to build a palace by the side of the
cottage, and it was raised on pillars of gold, in which
were set great diamonds, which blazed night and day.
Of course the news of this palace was the first thing
that reached the king her father, on his return from the
wars, and he hurried to see it. In the doorway stood a
young man of twenty, who was his grandson, though
neither of them knew it, and so pleased was the king
with the appearance of the youth, that he carried him
back to his own palace, and made him commander of the
whole army.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the widow&rsquo;s son returned to his
native land. There, sure enough, was the tiny cottage
where he had lived with his mother, but the gorgeous
building beside it was quite new to him. What had
become of his wife and his mother, and who could be
dwelling in that other wonderful place. These were
the first thoughts that flashed through his mind; but not
wishing to betray himself by asking questions of passing
strangers, he climbed up into a tree that stood opposite
the palace and watched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>
By-and-by a lady came out, and began to gather some
of the roses and jessamine that hung about the porch.
The twenty years that had passed since he had last beheld
her vanished in an instant, and he knew her to be his own
wife, looking almost as young and beautiful as on the
day of their parting. He was about to jump down from
the tree and hasten to her side, when she was joined by
a young man who placed his arm affectionately round
her neck. At this sight the angry husband drew his
bow, but before he could let fly the arrow, the counsel
of the wise man came back to him: &lsquo;Patience is the first
step on the road to happiness.&rsquo; And he laid it down
again.</p>

<p>At this moment the princess turned, and drawing her
companion&rsquo;s head down to hers, kissed him on each cheek.
A second time blind rage filled the heart of the watcher,
and he snatched up his bow from the branch where it
hung, when words, heard long since, seemed to sound in
his ears:</p>

<p>&lsquo;He wins who waits.&rsquo; And the bow dropped to his
side. Then, through the silent air came the sound of the
youth&rsquo;s voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother, can you tell me nothing about my father? Does
he still live, and will he never return to us?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas! my son, how can I answer you?&rsquo; replied the lady.
&lsquo;Twenty years have passed since he left us to make his
fortune, and, in that time, only once have I heard aught
of him. But what has brought him to your mind just
now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because last night I dreamed that he was here,&rsquo; said
the youth, &lsquo;and then I remembered what I have so long
forgotten, that I <em>had</em> a father, though even his very history
was strange to me. And now, tell me, I pray you, all you
can concerning him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And standing under the jessamine, the son learnt his
father&rsquo;s history, and the man in the tree listened also.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; exclaimed the youth, when it was ended, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
he twisted his hands in pain, &lsquo;I am general-in-chief, you
are the king&rsquo;s daughter, and we have the most splendid
palace in the whole world, yet my father lives we know
not where, and for all we can guess, may be poor and
miserable. To-morrow I will ask the king to give me
soldiers, and I will seek him over the whole earth till I
find him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the man came down from the tree, and clasped
his wife and son in his arms. All that night they talked,
and when the sun rose it still found them talking. But
as soon as it was proper, he went up to the palace to pay
his homage to the king, and to inform him of all that had
happened and who they all really were. The king was
overjoyed to think that his daughter, whom he had long
since forgiven and sorely missed, was living at his gates,
and was, besides, the mother of the youth who was so dear
to him. &lsquo;It was written beforehand,&rsquo; cried the monarch.
&lsquo;You are my son-in-law before the world, and shall be
king after me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the man bowed his head.</p>

<p>He had waited; and he had won.</p>

<h2><i>THE STEEL CANE</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived an old woman who had
a small cottage on the edge of the forest. Behind the
cottage was a garden in which all sorts of vegetables grew,
and, beyond that, a field with two or three cows in it, so
her neighbours considered her quite rich, and envied her
greatly.</p>

<p>As long as she was strong enough to work all day in
her garden the old woman never felt lonely, but after a
while she had a bad illness, which left her much weaker
than before, and she began to think that now and then
it would be nice to have some one to speak to. Just at
this moment she heard of the death of a shepherd and
his wife, who dwelt on the other side of the plain, leaving
a little boy quite alone in the world.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That will just suit me,&rsquo; she said; and sent a man over
to bring the child, whom she intended to adopt for
her own.</p>

<p>Now the boy, who was about twelve years old, ought
to have considered himself very lucky, for his new mother
was as kind to him as the old one. But, unfortunately,
he made friends with some bad rude companions whose
tricks caused them to be a terror to everyone, and the
poor old woman never ceased regretting her lost solitude.</p>

<p>Things went on in this way for some years, till the boy
became a man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, if he were to be married he might sober
down,&rsquo; she thought to herself. And she inquired among
the neighbours what girls there were of an age to choose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
from. At length one was found, good and industrious, as
well as pretty; and as the young man raised no objections
the wedding took place at once, and the bride and bridegroom
went to live in the cottage with the old woman.
But no change was to be seen in the husband&rsquo;s conduct.
All day long he was out amusing himself in the company
of his former friends, and if his wife dared to say anything
to him on his return home he beat her with his stick.
And next year, when a baby was born to them, he beat
it also.</p>

<p>At length the old woman&rsquo;s patience was worn out. She
saw that it was quite useless to expect the lazy, idle creature
to mend his ways, and one day she said to him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to go on like this for ever? Remember,
you are no longer a boy, and it is time that you left off
behaving like one. Come, shake off your bad habits, and
work for your wife and child, and above all, stop beating
them. If not I will transform you into an ass, and heavy
loads shall be piled on your back, and men shall ride you.
Briars shall be your food, a goad shall prick you, and in
your turn you shall know how it feels to be beaten.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But if she expected her words to do any good she soon
found out her mistake, for the young man only grew angry
and cried rudely:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bah! hold your tongue or I will whip you also.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Will</em> you?&rsquo; she answered grimly: and, swift as lightning
she picked up a steel cane that stood in the corner and laid
it across his shoulders. In an instant his ears had grown
long and his face longer, his arms had become legs, and
his body was covered with close grey hair. Truly, he was
an ass; and a very ugly one, too!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Leave the house!&rsquo; commanded the old woman. And,
shambling awkwardly, he went.</p>

<p>As he was standing in the path outside, not knowing
what to do, a man passed by.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ho! my fine fellow, you are exactly what I was looking
for! You don&rsquo;t seem to have a master, so come with me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
I will find something for you to do.&rsquo; And taking him by
the ear he led him from the cottage.</p>

<p>For seven years the ass led a hard life, just as the old
woman had foretold. But instead of remembering that
he had brought all his suffering on himself, and being
sorry for his evil ways, he grew harder, and more bitter.
At the end of the seven years his ass skin wore out,
and he became a man again, and one day returned to the
cottage.</p>

<p>His wife opened the door in answer to his knock; then,
letting fall the latch, she ran inside, crying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Grandmother! grandmother! your son has come
back!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought he would,&rsquo; replied the old woman, going on
with her spinning. &lsquo;Well, we could have done very well
without him. But as he is here I suppose he must come
in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And come in he did. But as the old woman expected,
he behaved still worse than before. For some weeks she
allowed him to do what he liked; then at last she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;So experience has taught you nothing! After all, there
are very few people who have sense to learn by it. But
take care lest I change you into a wolf, to be a prey for dogs
and men!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You talk too much. I shall break your head for you!&rsquo;
was all the answer she got.</p>

<p>Had the young man looked at her face he might have
taken warning, but he was busy making a pipe, and took
no notice. The next moment the steel cane had touched
his shoulders, and a big grey wolf bounded through the
door.</p>

<p>Oh! what a yapping among the dogs, and what a shouting
among the neighbours as they gave chase.</p>

<p>For seven years he led the life of a hunted animal,
often cold and nearly always hungry, and never daring to
allow himself a sound sleep. At the end of that time his
wolf skin wore out also, and again he appeared at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
cottage door. But the second seven years had taught
him no more than the first&mdash;his conduct was worse than
before; and one day he beat his wife and son so brutally
that they screamed to the old woman to come to their
aid.</p>

<p>She did, and brought the steel cane with her. In a second
the ruffian had vanished, and a big black crow was flying
about the room, crying &lsquo;Gour! Gour!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The window was open, and he darted through it; and
seeking the companions who had ruined him, he managed
to make them understand what had happened.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We will avenge you,&rsquo; said they; and taking up a rope,
set out to strangle the old woman.</p>

<p>But she was ready for them. One stroke of her cane
and they were all changed into a troop of black crows, and
<em>this</em> time their feathers are lasting still.</p>

<h2><i>THE PUNISHMENT OF THE FAIRY
GANGANA</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who ruled
over a country so small that you could easily walk
round it in one day. They were both very good, simple
people; not very wise, perhaps, but anxious to be kind
to everybody; and this was often a mistake, for the king
allowed all his subjects to talk at once, and offer advice
upon the government of the kingdom as well as upon private
matters. And the end of it all was, that it was very difficult
to get any laws made, and, still more, to get anyone to obey
them.</p>

<p>Now, no traveller ever passed through the kingdom
without inquiring how it came to be so small. And this
was the reason. As soon as Petaldo (for that was the
king&rsquo;s name) had been born, his father and mother betrothed
him to the niece of their friend the fairy Gangana&mdash;if
she should ever have one. But as the years passed on,
and Gangana was still without a niece, the young prince
forgot all about his destined bride, and when he was twenty-five
he secretly married the beautiful daughter of a
rich farmer, with whom he had fallen violently in
love.</p>

<p>When the fairy heard the news she fell into a violent
rage, and hurried off to tell the king. The old man
thought in his heart that his son had waited quite long
enough; but he did not dare to say so, lest some dreadful
spell might be thrown over them all, and they should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>
changed into birds or snakes, or, worst of all, into stones.
So, much against his will, he was obliged to disinherit
the young man, and to forbid him to come to court.
Indeed, he would have been a beggar had it not been
for the property his wife had had given her by the
farmer, which the youth obtained permission to erect into
a kingdom.</p>

<p>Most princes would have been very angry at this treatment,
especially as the old king soon died, and the queen
was delighted to reign in his place. But Petaldo was a
contented young man, and was quite satisfied with arranging
his tiny court on the model of his father&rsquo;s, and having
a lord chamberlain, and a high steward and several gentlemen
in attendance; while the young queen appointed her
own ladies-in-waiting and maids of honour. He likewise
set up a mint to coin money, and chose a seneschal as head
of the five policemen who kept order in the capital and
punished the boys who were caught in the act of throwing
stones at the palace windows.</p>

<p>The first to fill this important office was the young king&rsquo;s
father-in-law, an excellent man of the name of Caboche.
He was much beloved by everyone, and so sensible that
he was not at all vain at rising at once to the dignity of
seneschal, when he had only been a common farmer, but
went about his fields every day as usual. This conduct
so struck his king that very soon he never did anything
without consulting him.</p>

<p>Each morning Caboche and his son-in-law had breakfast
together, and when they had finished, the king took
out of his iron chest great bundles of state papers, which
he desired to talk over with his seneschal. Sometimes they
would spend two hours at least in deciding these important
matters, but more often after a few minutes Caboche would
say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Excuse me, sire, but your majesty does not understand
this affair in the least. Leave it to me, and I will settle
it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
&lsquo;But what am I to do, then?&rsquo; asked the king. And his
minister answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you can rule your wife, and see after your fruit
garden. You will find that those two things will take
up all your time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps you are right,&rsquo; the king replied; secretly
glad to be rid of the cares of government. But though
Caboche did all the work, Petaldo never failed to appear
on grand occasions, in his royal mantle of red linen, holding
a sceptre of gilded wood. Meanwhile he passed his
mornings in studying books, from which he learned the
proper seasons to plant his fruit trees, and when they should
be pruned; and his afternoons in his garden, where he put
his knowledge into practice. In the evening he played
cards with his father-in-law, and supped in public with
the queen, and by ten o&rsquo;clock everybody in the palace was
fast asleep.</p>

<p>The queen, on her side, was quite as happy as her husband.
She loved to be in her dairy, and nobody in the
kingdom could make such delicious cheeses. But however
busy she might be, she never forgot to bake a little
barley cake, and make a tiny cream cheese, and to put
them under a particular rose-tree in the garden. If you
had asked her whom they were for, and where they went
to, she could not have told you, but would have said that
on the night of her marriage a fairy had appeared to her
in a dream, and had bidden her to perform this ceremony.</p>

<p>After the king and the queen had six children, a little
boy was born, with a small red cap on his head, so that
he was quite different from his brothers and sisters, and
his parents loved Cadichon better than any of them.</p>

<p>The years went on, and the children were growing big,
when, one day, after Gillette the queen had finished baking
her cake, and had turned it out on a plate, a lovely blue
mouse crept up the leg of the table and ran to the plate.
Instead of chasing it away, as most women would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
done, the queen pretended not to notice what the mouse
was doing, and was much surprised to see the little
creature pick up the cake and carry it off to the
chimney. She sprang forwards to stop it, when, suddenly,
both the mouse and cake vanished, and in their place
stood an old woman only a foot high, whose clothes
hung in rags about her. Taking up a sharp pointed iron
stick, she drew on the earthen floor some strange signs,
uttering seven cries as she did so, and murmuring
something in a low voice, among which the queen was
sure she caught the words, &lsquo;faith,&rsquo; &lsquo;wisdom,&rsquo; &lsquo;happiness.&rsquo;
Then, seizing the kitchen broom, she whirled it three times
round her head, and vanished. Immediately there arose
a great noise in the next room, and on opening the door,
the queen beheld three large cockchafers, each one with
a princess between its feet, while the princes were seated
on the backs of three swallows. In the middle was a car
formed of a single pink shell, and drawn by two robin redbreasts,
and in this car Cadichon was sitting by the side
of the blue mouse, who was dressed in a splendid mantle
of black velvet fastened under her chin. Before the queen
had recovered from her surprise, cockchafers, redbreasts,
mouse and children had all flown, singing, to the window,
and disappeared from view.</p>

<p>The loud shrieks of the queen brought her husband
and father running into the room, and when at last they
made out from her broken sentences what had really happened,
they hastily snatched up some stout sticks that
were lying about and set off to the rescue&mdash;one going in
one direction and the other in another.</p>

<p>For at least an hour the queen sat sobbing where
they had left her, when at last she was roused by a piece
of folded paper falling at her feet. She stooped and
picked it up eagerly, hoping that it might contain some
news of her lost children. It was very short, but when
she had read the few words, Gillette was comforted, for
it bade her take heart, as they were well and happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
under the protection of a fairy. &lsquo;On your own faith
and prudence depend your happiness,&rsquo; ended the writer.
&lsquo;It is I who have all these years eaten the food you
placed under the rose-tree, and some day I shall reward
you for it. &ldquo;Everything comes to him who knows
how to wait,&rdquo; is the advice given by,&mdash;The Fairy of the
Fields.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the queen rose up, and bathed her face, and combed
her shining hair; and as she turned away from her mirror
she beheld a linnet sitting on her bed. No one would
have known that it was anything but a common linnet,
and yesterday the queen would have thought so too. But
this morning so many wonderful things had happened
that she did not doubt for a moment that the writer of the
letter was before her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pretty linnet,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I will try to do all you wish.
Only give me, I pray you, now and then, news of my little
Cadichon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the linnet flapped her wings and sang, and flew
away. So the queen knew that she had guessed rightly,
and thanked her in her heart.</p>

<p>By-and-by the king and his seneschal returned, hungry
and tired with their fruitless search. They were amazed
and rather angry to find the queen, whom they had left
weeping, quite cheerful. Could she <em>really</em> care for her
children so little and have forgotten them so soon? What
<em>could</em> have caused this sudden change? But to all their
questions Gillette would only answer: &lsquo;Everything comes
to him who knows how to wait.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; replied her father; &lsquo;and, after all, your
majesty must remember that the revenues of your kingdom
would hardly bear the cost of seven princes and
princesses brought up according to their rank. Be
grateful, then, to those who have relieved you of the
burden.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are right! You are always right!&rsquo; cried the
king, whose face once more beamed with smiles. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
life at the palace went on as before, till Petaldo received a
piece of news which disturbed him greatly.</p>

<p>The queen, his mother, who had for some time been
a widow, suddenly made up her mind to marry again,
and her choice had fallen on the young king of the
Green Isles, who was younger than her own son, and,
besides, handsome and fond of pleasure, which Petaldo
was not. Now the grandmother, foolish though she
was in many respects, had the sense to see that a
woman as old and as plain as she was, could hardly
expect a young man to fall in love with her, and that,
if this was to happen, it would be needful to find some
spell which would bring back her youth and beauty. Of
course, the fairy Gangana could have wrought the change
with one wave of her wand; but unluckily the two
were no longer friends, because the fairy had tried
hard to persuade the queen to declare her niece heiress
to the crown, which the queen refused to do. Naturally,
therefore, it was no use asking the help of Gangana
to enable the queen to take a second husband, who
would be certain to succeed her; and messengers were
sent all over the neighbouring kingdoms, seeking to find a
witch or a fairy who would work the wished-for miracle.
None, however, could be found with sufficient skill, and
at length the queen saw that if ever the king of the Green
Isles was to be her husband she must throw herself on the
mercy of the fairy Gangana.</p>

<p>The fairy&rsquo;s wrath was great when she heard the queen&rsquo;s
story, but she knew very well that, as the king of the Green
Isles had spent all his money, he would probably be ready
to marry even an old woman, like her friend, in order to
get more. So, in order to gain time, she hid her feelings,
and told the queen that in three days the spell would be
accomplished.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Her words made the queen so happy that twenty
years seemed to fall from her at once, and she counted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
not only the hours, but the minutes to the appointed
time. It came at last, and the fairy stood before her in
a long robe of pink and silver, held up by a tiny brown
dwarf, who carried a small box under his arm. The
queen received her with all the marks of respect that
she could think of, and at the request of Gangana,
ordered the doors and windows of the great hall to be
closed, and her attendants to retire, so that she and her
guest might be quite alone. Then, opening the box,
which was presented to her on one knee by the dwarf,
the fairy took from it a small vellum book with silver
clasps, a wand that lengthened out as you touched it,
and a crystal bottle filled with very clear green water.
She next bade the queen sit on a seat in the middle of
the room, and the dwarf to stand opposite her, after
which she stooped down and drew three circles round
them with a golden rod, touched each of them thrice
with her wand, and sprinkled the liquid over both.
Gradually the queen&rsquo;s big features began to grow smaller
and her face fresher, while at the same time the dwarf
became about twice as tall as he had been before. This
sight, added to the blue flames which sprang up from the
three circles, so frightened the queen that she fainted in
her chair, and when she recovered, both the page and the
fairy had vanished.</p>

<p>At first she felt vaguely puzzled, not remembering
clearly what had happened; then it all came back to
her, and jumping up she ran to the nearest mirror.
Oh! how happy she was! Her long nose and her
projecting teeth had become things of beauty, her hair
was thick and curly, and bright gold. The fairy had indeed
fulfilled her promise! But, in her hurry and pleasure,
the queen never noticed that she had not been changed
into a beautiful young lady, but into a very tall little
girl of eight or nine years old! Instead of her magnificent
velvet dress, edged with fur and embroidered in
gold, she wore a straight muslin frock, with a little lace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span>
apron, while her hair, which was always combed and
twisted and fastened with diamond pins, hung in curls
down her back. But if she had only known, something
besides this had befallen her, for except as regards her
love for the king of the Green Isles, her mind as well
as her face had become that of a child, and this her
courtiers were aware of, if she was not. Of course they
could not imagine what had occurred, and did not know
how to behave themselves, till the chief minister set
them the example by ordering his wife and daughters
to copy the queen&rsquo;s clothes and way of speaking. Then,
in a short time, the whole court, including the men,
talked and dressed like children, and played with dolls,
or little tin soldiers, while at the state dinners nothing
was seen but iced fruits, or sweet cakes made in the
shape of birds and horses. But whatever she might be
doing, the queen hardly ceased talking about the king
of the Green Isles, whom she always spoke of as &lsquo;my little
husband,&rsquo; and as weeks passed on, and he did not come,
she began to get very cross and impatient, so that her
courtiers kept away from her as much as they could. By
this time, too, they were growing tired of pretending to
be children, and whispered their intention of leaving the
palace and taking service under a neighbouring sovereign,
when, one day, a loud blast of trumpets announced
the arrival of the long-expected guest. In an instant all
was smiles again, and in spite of the strictest rules of court
etiquette, the queen insisted on receiving the young king
at the bottom of the stairs. Unfortunately, in her haste,
she fell over her dress, and rolled down several steps,
screaming like a child, from fright. She was not really
much hurt, though she had scratched her nose and
bruised her forehead, but she was obliged to be carried
to her room and have her face bathed in cold water.
Still, in spite of this, she gave strict orders that the
king should be brought to her presence the moment he
entered the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
A shrill blast outside her door sent a twinge of pain
through the queen&rsquo;s head, which by this time was aching
badly; but in her joy at welcoming her future husband
she paid no heed to it. Between two lines of courtiers,
bowing low, the young king advanced quickly; but at
the sight of the queen and her bandages, broke out into
such violent fits of laughter that he was forced to leave
the room, and even the palace.</p>

<p>When the queen had recovered from the vexation
caused by the king&rsquo;s rude behaviour, she bade her
attendants to hasten after him and fetch him back, but
no promises or entreaties would persuade him to return.
This of course made the queen&rsquo;s temper even worse than
it was before, and a plot was set on foot to deprive her
of the crown, which would certainly have succeeded
had not the fairy Gangana, who had only wished to
prevent her marriage, restored her to her proper shape.
But, far from thanking her friend for this service, the
sight of her old face in the mirror filled her with despair;
and from that day she hated Gangana with a deadly
hatred.</p>

<p>And where were Petaldo&rsquo;s children all this while?
Why, in the island of Bambini, where they had playfellows
to their hearts&rsquo; content, and plenty of fairies to
take care of them all. But out of all the seven princes
and princesses whom the queen had seen carried off
through the window, there was only Cadichon who was
good and obedient; the other six were so rude and
quarrelsome that they could get no one to play with
them, and at last, as a punishment, the fairy changed
them all into marionettes, till they should learn to behave
better.</p>

<p>Now, in an unlucky moment, the Fairy of the Fields
determined to visit her friend the queen of the fairies,
who lived in a distant island, in order to consult her as to
what was to become of Cadichon.</p>

<p>As she was entering the Hall of Audience, Gangana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
was leaving it, and sharp words were exchanged between
them. After her enemy had flown off in a rage, the Fairy
of the Fields poured out the whole story of Gangana&rsquo;s
wickedness to the queen, and implored her counsel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Be comforted,&rsquo; answered the fairy queen. &lsquo;For a
while she must work her will, and at this moment she is
carrying off Cadichon to the island where she still holds
her niece captive. But should she make an evil use of
the power she has, her punishment will be swift and
great. And now I will give you this precious phial.
Guard it carefully, for the liquid it contains will cause
you to become invisible, and safe from the piercing eyes
of all fairies. Against the eyes of mortals it has no
charm!&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a heart somewhat lighter, the Fairy of the Fields
returned to her own island, and, the better to protect the
six new marionettes from the wicked fairy, she sprinkled
them with a few drops of the liquid, only avoiding just
the tips of their noses, so that she might be able to
know them again. Then she set off for the kingdom of
Petaldo, which she found in a state of revolt, because
for the first time since he had ascended the throne he
had dared to impose a tax. Indeed, matters might have
ended in a war, or in cutting off the king&rsquo;s head, had not
the fairy discovered a means of contenting everybody,
and of whispering anew to the queen that all was well
with her children, for she dared not tell her of the loss of
Cadichon.</p>

<p>And what had become of Cadichon? Well, the Fairy
of the Fields had found out&mdash;by means of her books,
which had told her&mdash;that the poor little boy had
been placed by Gangana in an enchanted island, round
which flowed a rapid river, sweeping rocks and trees in
its current. Besides the river, the island was guarded
by twenty-four enormous dragons, breathing flames, and
forming a rampart of fire which it seemed as if none could
pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
The Fairy of the Fields knew all this, but she had a
brave heart, and determined that by some means or other
she would overcome all obstacles, and rescue Cadichon
from the power of Gangana. So, taking with her the
water of invisibility, she sprinkled it over her, and
mounting her favourite winged lizard, set out for the
island. When it appeared in sight she wrapped herself
in her fireproof mantle; then, bidding the lizard return
home, she slipped past the dragons and entered the
island.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she done so than she beheld Gangana
approaching her, talking loudly and angrily to a genius
who flew by her side. From what she said, the fairy
learned that Petaldo&rsquo;s mother, the old queen, had died
of rage on hearing of the marriage of the king of the Green
Isles to a young and lovely bride, and instead of leaving
her kingdom to Gangana, had bequeathed it to one of the
children of her son Petaldo.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But all the trouble I have had with that foolish old
woman shall not go for nothing,&rsquo; cried Gangana. &lsquo;Go
at once to my stables, and fetch out the strongest and swiftest
griffins you can find in the stalls, and harness them to the
yellow coach. Drive this, with all the speed you may, to
the Isle of Bambini, and carry off the six children of Petaldo
that are still there. I will see to Petaldo and Gillette
myself. When I have got them all safe here I will change
the parents into rabbits and the children into dogs. As
for Cadichon, I have not quite made up my mind what
I shall do with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Fairy of the Fields did not wait to hear more. No
time was to be lost in seeking the help of the fairy
queen if Petaldo and his family were to be saved from
this dreadful doom. So, without waiting to summon her
lizard, she flew across the island and past the dragons
till her feet once more touched the ground again. But
at that instant a black cloud rolled over her, loud thunder
rent the air, and the earth rocked beneath her. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
wild lightnings lit up the sky, and by their flashes
she saw the four-and-twenty dragons fighting together,
uttering shrieks and yells, till the whole earth must have
heard the uproar. Trembling with terror, the fairy
stood rooted to the spot; and when day broke, island,
torrent, and dragons had vanished, and in their stead
was a barren rock. On the summit of the rock stood
a black ostrich, and on its back were seated Cadichon,
and the little niece of the fairy Gangana, for whose sake
she had committed so many evil deeds. While the Fairy
of the Fields was gazing in surprise at this strange sight,
the ostrich spread its wings and flew off in the direction
of the Fortunate Isle, and, followed unseen by the good
fairy, entered the great hall where the queen was sitting
on her throne.</p>

<p>Proud and exultant was Gangana in her new shape,
for, by all the laws of fairydom, if she succeeded in
laying Cadichon at the feet of the queen, and received
him back from her, he was in her power for life, and she
might do with him as she would. This the good fairy
knew well, and pressed on with all her strength, for the
dreadful events of the night had almost exhausted her.
But, with a mighty effort, she snatched the children away
from the back of the ostrich, and placed them on the lap
of the queen.</p>

<p>With a scream of baffled rage the ostrich turned away,
and Gangana stood in her place, waiting for the doom which
she had brought upon herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have neglected all my warnings,&rsquo; said the
queen, speaking more sternly than any fairy had ever
heard her; &lsquo;and my sentence is that during two hundred
years you lose all your privileges as a fairy, and
under the form of an ostrich shall become the slave
of the lowest and wickedest of the genii whom you
have made your friends. As for these children, I shall
keep them with me, and they shall be brought up at my
court.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
And so they were, until they grew up and were old
enough to be married. Then the Fairy of the Fields took
them back to the kingdom of the old queen, where Petaldo
was now reigning. But the cares of state proved too
heavy both for him and Gillette, after the quiet life they
had led for so many years, and they were rejoiced to be
able to lay aside their crowns, and place them on the
heads of Cadichon and his bride, who was as good as
she was beautiful, though she <em>was</em> the niece of the wicked
Gangana! And so well had Cadichon learned the lessons
taught him at the court of the fairy queen, that never since
the kingdom <em>was</em> a kingdom had the people been so well
governed or so happy. And they went about the streets
and the fields smiling with joy at the difference between
the old times and the new, and whispering softly to each
other:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Everything comes to him who knows how to wait.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><i>THE SILENT PRINCESS</i></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in Turkey a pasha who had
only one son, and so dearly did he love this boy that he let
him spend the whole day amusing himself, instead of learning
how to be useful like his friends.</p>

<p>Now the boy&rsquo;s favourite toy was a golden ball, and with
this he would play from morning till night, without troubling
anybody. One day, as he was sitting in the summer-house
in the garden, making his ball run all along the
walls and catching it again, he noticed an old woman
with an earthen pitcher coming to draw water from a
well which stood in a corner of the garden. In a moment
he had caught his ball and flung it straight at the pitcher,
which fell to the ground in a thousand pieces. The old
woman started with surprise, but said nothing; only turned
round to fetch another pitcher, and as soon as she had
disappeared, the boy hurried out to pick up his ball.</p>

<p>Scarcely was he back in the summer-house when he beheld
the old woman a second time, approaching the well
with the pitcher on her shoulder. She had just taken hold
of the handle to lower it into the water, when&mdash;crash!
And the pitcher lay in fragments at her feet. Of
course she felt very angry, but for fear of the pasha she
still held her peace, and spent her last pence in buying
a fresh pitcher. But when this also was broken by a blow
from the ball, her wrath burst forth, and shaking her fist
towards the summer-house where the boy was hiding,
she cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish you may be punished by falling in love with
the silent princess.&rsquo; And having said this she vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span>
For some time the boy paid no heed to her words&mdash;indeed
he forgot them altogether; but as years went by,
and he began to think more about things, the remembrance
of the old woman&rsquo;s wish came back to his mind.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who is the silent princess? And why should it be a
punishment to fall in love with her?&rsquo; he asked himself,
and received no answer. However, that did not prevent
him from putting the question again and again, till at
length he grew so weak and ill that he could eat nothing,
and in the end was forced to lie in bed altogether. His
father the pasha became so frightened by this strange disease,
that he sent for every physician in the kingdom to
cure him, but no one was able to find a remedy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How did your illness first begin, my son?&rsquo; asked the
pasha one day. &lsquo;Perhaps, if we knew that, we should
also know better what to do for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the youth told him what had happened all those
years before, when he was a little boy, and what the old
woman had said to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give me, I pray you,&rsquo; he cried, when his tale was finished,
&lsquo;give me, I pray you, leave to go into the world in
search of the princess, and perhaps this evil state may
cease.&rsquo; And, sore though his heart was to part from his
only son, the pasha felt that the young man would certainly
die if he remained at home any longer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go, and peace be with you,&rsquo; he answered; and went
out to call his trusted steward, whom he ordered to accompany
his young master.</p>

<p>Their preparations were soon made, and early one
morning the two set out. But neither old man nor
young had the slightest idea where they were going,
or what they were undertaking. First they lost their
way in a dense forest, and from that they at length
emerged in a wilderness where they wandered for six
months, not seeing a living creature and finding scarcely
anything to eat or drink, till they became nothing but
skin and bone, while their garments hung in tatters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>
about them. They had forgotten all about the princess,
and their only wish was to find themselves back in the
palace again, when, one day, they discovered that they
were standing on the shoulder of a mountain. The stones
beneath them shone as brightly as diamonds, and both
their hearts beat with joy at beholding a tiny old man
approaching them. The sight awoke all manner of recollections;
the numb feeling that had taken possession of
them fell away as if by magic, and it was with glad voices
that they greeted the new-comer. &lsquo;Where are we, my
friend?&rsquo; asked they; and the old man told them that this
was the mountain where the sultan&rsquo;s daughter sat, covered
by seven veils, and the shining of the stones was only the
reflection of her own brilliance.</p>

<p>On hearing this news all the dangers and difficulties
of their past wandering vanished from their minds.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can I reach her soonest?&rsquo; asked the youth eagerly.
But the old man only answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have patience, my son, yet awhile. Another six months
must go by before you arrive at the palace where she dwells
with the rest of the women. And, even so, think well,
when you can, as should you fail to make her speak, you
will have to pay forfeit with your life, as others have done.
So beware!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the prince only laughed at this counsel&mdash;as others
had also done.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>After three months they found themselves on the top
of another mountain, and the prince saw with surprise
that its sides were coloured a beautiful red. Perched on
some cliffs, not far off, was a small village, and the prince
proposed to his friend that they should go and rest there.
The villagers, on their part, welcomed them gladly, and
gave them food to eat and beds to sleep on, and thankful
indeed were the two travellers to repose their weary
limbs.</p>

<p>The next morning they asked their host if he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
tell them whether they were still many days&rsquo; journey from
the princess, and whether he knew why the mountain was
so much redder than other mountains.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For three and a half more months you must still
pursue your way,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;and by that time you
will find yourselves at the gate of the princess&rsquo;s palace.
As for the colour of the mountain, that comes from the
soft hue of her cheeks and mouth, which shines through
the seven veils which cover her. But none have ever
beheld her face, for she sits there, uttering no word, though
one hears whispers of many having lost their lives for
her sake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince, however, would listen no further; and thanking
the man for his kindness, he jumped up and, with the
steward, set out to climb the mountain.</p>

<p>On and on and on they went, sleeping under the trees
or in caves, and living upon berries and any fish they could
catch in the rivers. But at length, when their clothes
were nearly in rags and their legs so tired that they could
hardly walk any further, they saw on the top of the next
mountain a palace of yellow marble.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There it is, at last,&rsquo; cried the prince; and fresh blood
seemed to spring in his veins. But as he and his companion
began to climb towards the top they paused in
horror, for the ground was white with dead men&rsquo;s skulls.
It was the prince who first recovered his voice, and he
said to his friend, as carelessly as he could:</p>

<p>&lsquo;These must be the skulls of the men who tried to make
the princess speak and failed. Well, if we fail too, our
bones will strew the ground likewise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! turn back now, my prince, while there is yet time,&rsquo;
entreated his companion. &lsquo;Your father gave you into
my charge; but when we set out I did not know that certain
death lay before us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take heart, O Lala, take heart!&rsquo; answered the prince.
&lsquo;A man can but die once. And, besides, the princess
will have to speak <em>some</em> day, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
So they went on again, past skulls and dead men&rsquo;s bones
in all degrees of whiteness. And by-and-by they reached
another village, where they determined to rest for a little
while, so that their wits might be fresh and bright for
the task that lay before them. But this time, though
the people were kind and friendly, their faces were
gloomy, and every now and then woeful cries would rend
the air.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! my brother, have I lost you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh! my son, shall
I see you no more?&rsquo; And then, as the prince and his companion
asked the meaning of these laments&mdash;which,
indeed, was plain enough&mdash;the answer was given:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, you also have come hither to die! This town
belongs to the father of the princess, and when any rash
man seeks to move the princess to speech he must first
obtain leave of the sultan. If that is granted him he is
then led into the presence of the princess. What happens
afterwards, perhaps the sight of these bones may help you
to guess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man bowed his head in token of thanks,
and stood thoughtful for a short time. Then, turning to
the Lala, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, our destiny will soon be decided! Meanwhile
we will find out all we can, and do nothing rashly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For two or three days they wandered about the bazaars,
keeping their eyes and ears open, when, one morning,
they met a man carrying a nightingale in a cage. The
bird was singing so joyously that the prince stopped to
listen, and at once offered to buy him from his owner.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, why cumber yourself with such a useless thing,&rsquo;
cried the Lala in disgust; &lsquo;have you not enough to occupy
your hands and mind, without taking an extra burden?&rsquo;
But the prince, who liked having his own way, paid no
heed to him, and paying the high price asked by the man,
he carried the bird back to the inn, and hung him up in his
chamber. That evening, as he was sitting alone, trying
to think of something that would make the princess talk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
and failing altogether, the nightingale pecked open her
cage door, which was lightly fastened by a stick, and,
perching on his shoulder, murmured softly in his ear:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What makes you so sad, my prince?&rsquo; The young man
started. In his native country birds did not talk, and,
like many people, he was always rather afraid of what
he did not understand. But in a moment he felt ashamed
of his folly, and explained that he had travelled for more
than a year, and over thousands of miles, to win the hand
of the sultan&rsquo;s daughter. And now that he had reached
his goal he could think of no plan to force her to
speak.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! do not trouble your head about that,&rsquo; replied the
bird, &lsquo;it is quite easy! Go this evening to the women&rsquo;s
apartments, and take me with you, and when you enter
the princess&rsquo;s private chamber hide me under the pedestal
which supports the great golden candlestick. The
princess herself will be wrapped so thickly in her seven
veils that she can see nothing, neither can her face be
seen by anyone. Then inquire after her health, but she
will remain quite silent; and next say that you are sorry
to have disturbed her, and that you will have a little talk
with the pedestal of the candlestick. When you speak I
will answer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince threw his mantle over the bird, and started
for the palace, where he begged an audience of the sultan.
This was soon granted him, and leaving the nightingale
hidden by the mantle, in a dark corner outside the door,
he walked up to the throne on which his highness was
sitting, and bowed low before him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is your request?&rsquo; asked the sultan, looking closely
at the young man, who was tall and handsome; but when
he heard the tale he shook his head pityingly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you can make her speak she shall be your wife,&rsquo;
answered he; &lsquo;but if not&mdash;did you mark the skulls that
strewed the mountain side?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Some day a man is bound to break the spell, O sultan,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>
replied the youth boldly; &lsquo;and why should not I be he as
well as another? At any rate, my word is pledged, and
I cannot draw back now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, go if you must,&rsquo; said the sultan. And he bade
his attendants lead the way to the chamber of the princess,
but to allow the young man to enter alone.</p>

<p>Catching up, unseen, his mantle and the cage as they
passed into the dark corridor&mdash;for by this time night was
coming on&mdash;the youth found himself standing in a room
bare except for a pile of silken cushions, and one tall golden
candlestick. His heart beat high as he looked at the
cushions, and knew that, shrouded within the shining
veils that covered them, lay the much longed-for princess.
Then, fearful that after all other eyes might be watching
him, he hastily placed the nightingale under the open
pedestal on which the candlestick was resting, and turning
again he steadied his voice, and besought the princess to
tell him of her well-being.</p>

<p>Not by even a movement of her hand did the princess
show that she had heard, and the young man, who of
course expected this, went on to speak of his travels and
of the strange countries he had passed through; but not
a sound broke the silence.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>&lsquo;I see clearly that you are interested in none of these
things,&rsquo; said he at last, &lsquo;and as I have been forced to hold
my peace for so many months, I feel that now I really
<em>must</em> talk to somebody, so I shall go and address my conversation
to the candlestick.&rsquo; And with that he crossed
the room behind the princess, and cried: &lsquo;O fairest of
candlesticks, how are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well indeed, my lord,&rsquo; answered the nightingale;
&lsquo;but I wonder how many years have gone by since any
one has spoken with me. And, now that you have come,
rest, I pray you, awhile, and listen to my story.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Willingly,&rsquo; replied the youth, curling himself up on
the floor, for there was no cushion for him to sit on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg&nbsp;325]</a></span>
&lsquo;Once upon a time,&rsquo; began the nightingale, &lsquo;there lived
a pasha whose daughter was the most beautiful maiden
in the whole kingdom. Suitors she had in plenty, but
she was not easy to please, and at length there were only
three whom she felt she could even <em>think</em> of marrying.
Not knowing which of the three she liked best, she took
counsel with her father, who summoned the young men
into his presence, and then told them that they must each
of them learn some trade, and whichever of them proved
the cleverest at the end of six months should become the
husband of the princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Though the three suitors may have been secretly disappointed,
they could not help feeling that this test was quite
fair, and left the palace together, talking as they went
of what handicrafts they might set themselves to follow.
The day was hot, and when they reached a spring that
gushed out of the side of the mountain, they stopped to
drink and rest, and then one of them said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It will be best that we should each seek our fortunes
alone; so let us put our rings under this stone, and go our
separate ways. And the first one who returns hither will
take his ring, and the others will take theirs. Thus we
shall know whether we have all fulfilled the commands of
the pasha, or if some accident has befallen any of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied the other two. And three rings were
placed in a little hole, and carefully covered again by the
stone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then they parted, and for six months they knew naught
of each other, till, on the day appointed, they met at
the spring. Right glad they all were, and eagerly they
talked of what they had done, and how the time had been
spent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think I shall win the princess,&rdquo; said the eldest, with
a laugh, &ldquo;for it is not everybody that is able to accomplish
a whole year&rsquo;s journey in an hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is very clever, certainly,&rdquo; answered his friend;
&ldquo;but if you are to govern a kingdom it may be still more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
useful to have the power of seeing what is happening at
a distance; and that is what <em>I</em> have learnt,&rdquo; replied the
second.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, no, my dear comrades,&rdquo; cried the third, &ldquo;your
trades are all very well; but when the pasha hears that
I can bring back the dead to life he will know which of
us three is to be his son-in-law. But come, there only
remain a few hours of the six months he granted us. It
is time that we hastened back to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; said the second, &ldquo;it would be well
to know what is going on in the palace.&rdquo; And plucking
some small leaves from a tree near by, he muttered some
words and made some signs, and laid them on his eyes.
In an instant he turned pale, and uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; exclaimed the others; and,
with a shaking voice, he gasped:</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The princess is lying on her bed, and has barely a
few minutes to live. Oh! can no one save her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<em>I</em> can,&rdquo; answered the third, taking a small box from
his turban; &ldquo;this ointment will cure any illness. But how
to reach her in time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said the first. And he wished himself
by the bedside of the princess, which was surrounded
by the sultan and his weeping courtiers. Clearly there
was not a second to lose, for the princess had grown
unconscious, and her face cold. Plunging his finger
into the ointment he touched her eyes, mouth and ears
with the paste, and with beating heart awaited the
result.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was swifter than he supposed. As he looked the
colour came back into her cheeks, and she smiled up at
her father. The sultan, almost speechless with joy at
this sudden change, embraced his daughter tenderly, and
then turned to the young man to whom he owed her
life:</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Are you not one of those three whom I sent forth
to learn a trade six months ago?&rdquo; asked he. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
young man answered yes, and that the other two were
even now on their way to the palace, so that the sultan
might judge between them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this point in his story the nightingale stopped, and
asked the prince which of the three he thought had the
best right to the princess.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="silent_princess" id="silent_princess"></a>
<img src="images/ofb52.jpg" width="500" height="492"
alt="The prince reclines, listening, as the princess speaks"
title="The silent princess speaks at last" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;The one who had learned how to prepare the ointment,&rsquo;
replied he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But if it had not been for the man who could see what
was happening at a distance they would never have known
that the princess was ill,&rsquo; said the nightingale. &lsquo;I would
give it to <em>him</em>.&rsquo; And the strife between them waxed hot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
till, suddenly, the listening princess started up from her
cushions and cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you fools! cannot you understand that if it had
not been for him who had power to reach the palace in
time the ointment itself would have been useless, for death
would have claimed her? It is he and no other who ought
to have the princess!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the first sound of the princess&rsquo;s voice, a slave, who
was standing at the door, ran at full speed to tell the sultan
of the miracle which had taken place, and the delighted
father hastened to the spot. But by this time the princess
perceived that she had fallen into a trap which had been
cunningly laid for her, and would not utter another word.
All she could be prevailed on to do was to make signs
to her father that the man who wished to be her husband
must induce her to speak three times. And she smiled
to herself beneath her seven veils as she thought of the
impossibility of <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>When the sultan told the prince that though he had
succeeded once, he would have twice to pass through the
same test, the young man&rsquo;s face clouded over. It did
not seem to him fair play, but he dared not object, so he
only bowed low, and contrived to step back close to the
spot where the nightingale was hidden. As it was now
quite dark he tucked unseen the little cage under his cloak,
and left the palace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why are you so gloomy?&rsquo; asked the nightingale, as
soon as they were safely outside. &lsquo;Everything has gone
exactly right! Of course the princess was very angry
with herself for having spoken. And did you see that,
at her first words, the veils that covered her began to rend?
Take me back to-morrow evening, and place me on the
pillar by the lattice. Fear nothing, you have only to trust
to me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The next evening, towards sunset, the prince left the
cage behind him, and with the bird in the folds of his
garment slipped into the palace and made his way straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
to the princess&rsquo;s apartments. He was at once admitted by
the slaves who guarded the door, and took care to pass
near the window so that the nightingale hopped unseen
to the top of a pillar. Then he turned and bowed low
to the princess, and asked her several questions; but, as
before, she answered nothing, and, indeed, gave no sign
that she heard. After a few minutes the young man bowed
again, and crossing over to the window, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, pillar! it is no use speaking to the princess, she
will not utter one word; and as I must talk to somebody,
I have come to you. Tell me how you have been all this
long while?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thank you,&rsquo; replied a voice from the pillar, &lsquo;I am
feeling very well. And it is lucky for me that the princess
is silent, or else you would not have wanted to speak to
me. To reward you, I will relate to you an interesting
tale that I lately overheard, and about which I should like
to have your opinion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That will be charming,&rsquo; answered the prince, &lsquo;so pray
begin at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time,&rsquo; said the nightingale, &lsquo;there lived
a woman who was so beautiful that every man who saw
her fell in love with her. But she was very hard to please,
and refused to wed any of them, though she managed to
keep friends with all. Years passed away in this manner,
almost without her noticing them, and one by one the
young men grew tired of waiting, and sought wives who
may have been less handsome, but were also less proud,
and at length only three of her former wooers remained&mdash;Baldschi,
Jagdschi, and Firedschi. Still she held herself
apart, thought herself better and lovelier than other
women, when, on a certain evening, her eyes were opened
at last to the truth. She was sitting before her mirror,
combing her curls, when amongst her raven locks she found
a long white hair!</p>

<p>&lsquo;At this dreadful sight her heart gave a jump, and then
stood still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg&nbsp;330]</a></span>
&lsquo;&ldquo;I am growing old,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;and if I do
not choose a husband soon, I shall never get one! I know
that either of those men would gladly marry me to-morrow,
but I cannot decide between them. I must invent some
way to find out which of them is the best, and lose no time
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So instead of going to sleep, she thought all night long
of different plans, and in the morning she arose and dressed
herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That will have to do,&rdquo; she muttered as she pulled
out the white hair which had cost her so much trouble.
&ldquo;It is not very good, but I can think of nothing better; and&mdash;well,
they are none of them clever, and I dare say they
will easily fall into the trap.&rdquo; Then she called her slave
and bade her let Jagdschi know that she would be ready
to receive him in an hour&rsquo;s time. After that she went into
the garden and dug a grave under a tree, by which she laid
a white shroud.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Jagdschi was delighted to get the gracious message;
and, putting on his newest garments, he hastened to the
lady&rsquo;s house, but great was his dismay at finding her
stretched on her cushions, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is the matter, O Fair One?&rdquo; he asked, bowing
low before her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A terrible thing has happened,&rdquo; said she, her voice
choked with sobs. &ldquo;My father died two nights ago, and
I buried him in my garden. But now I find that he was
a wizard, and was not dead at all, for his grave is empty
and he is wandering about somewhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is evil news indeed,&rdquo; answered Jagdschi; &ldquo;but
can I do nothing to comfort you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There is one thing you can do,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;and
that is to wrap yourself in the shroud and lay yourself
in the grave. If he should not return till after three hours
have elapsed he will have lost his power over me, and be
forced to go and wander elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now Jagdschi was proud of the trust reposed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
him, and wrapping himself in the shroud, he stretched
himself at full length in the grave. After some time
Baldschi arrived in his turn, and found the lady groaning
and lamenting. She told him that her father had been a
wizard, and that in case, as was very likely, he should
wish to leave his grave and come to work her evil, Baldschi
was to take a stone and be ready to crush in his head, if
he showed signs of moving.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Baldschi, enchanted at being able to do his lady a service,
picked up a stone, and seated himself by the side of
the grave wherein lay Jagdschi.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Meanwhile the hour arrived in which Firedschi was
accustomed to pay his respects, and, as in the case of the
other two, he discovered the lady overcome with grief.
To him she said that a wizard who was an enemy of her
father&rsquo;s had thrown the dead man out of his grave, and
had taken his place. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if you can bring
the wizard into my presence, all his power will go from
him; if not, then I am lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, lady, what is there that I would not do for you!&rdquo;
cried Firedschi; and running down to the grave, he seized
the astonished Jagdschi by the waist, and flinging the
body over his shoulder, he hastened with him into the
house. At the first moment Baldschi was so surprised
at this turn of affairs, for which the lady had not prepared
him, that he sat still and did nothing. But by-and-by
he sprang up and hurled the stone after the two flying figures,
hoping that it might kill them both. Fortunately
it touched neither, and soon all three were in the presence
of the lady. Then Jagdschi, thinking that he had delivered
her from the power of the wizard, slid off the back
of Firedschi, and threw the shroud from him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me, my prince,&rsquo; said the nightingale, when he
had finished his story, &lsquo;which of the three men deserved
to win the lady? I myself should choose Firedschi.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; answered the prince, who understood the
wink the bird had given him; &lsquo;it was Baldschi who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
took the most trouble, and it was certainly he who deserved
the lady.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the nightingale would not agree; and they began
to quarrel, till a third voice broke in:</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can you talk such nonsense?&rsquo; cried the princess&mdash;and
as she spoke a sound of tearing was heard.
&lsquo;Why, you have never even thought of Jagdschi, who
lay for three hours in the grave, with a stone held over
his head! Of course it was <em>he</em> whom the lady chose for
her husband!&rsquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>It was not many minutes before the news reached the
sultan; but even now he would not consent to the marriage
till his daughter had spoken a third time. On hearing
this, the young man took counsel with the nightingale
how best to accomplish this, and the bird told him that
as the princess, in her fury at having fallen into the snare
laid for her, had ordered the pillar to be broken in pieces,
he must be hidden in the folds of a curtain that hung by
the door.</p>

<p>The following evening the prince entered the palace,
and walked boldly up to the princess&rsquo;s apartments. As
he entered the nightingale flew from under his arm and
perched himself on top of the door, where he was entirely
concealed by the folds of the dark curtain. The young
man talked as usual to the princess without obtaining a
single word in reply, and at length he left her lying under
the heap of shining veils&mdash;now rent in many places&mdash;and
crossed the room towards the door, from which came a
voice that gladly answered him.</p>

<p>For a while the two talked together: then the nightingale
asked if the prince was fond of stories, as he had
lately heard one which interested and perplexed him greatly.
In reply, the prince begged that he might hear it at once,
and without further delay the nightingale began:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time, a carpenter, a tailor, and a student
set out together to see the world. After wandering about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span>
for some months they grew tired of travelling, and resolved
to stay and rest in a small town that took their fancy. So
they hired a little house, and looked about for work to do,
returning at sunset to smoke their pipes and talk over the
events of the day.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One night in the middle of summer it was hotter
than usual, and the carpenter found himself unable to
sleep. Instead of tossing about on his cushions, making
himself more uncomfortable than he was already, the
man wisely got up and drank some coffee and lit his
long pipe. Suddenly his eye fell on some pieces of
wood in a corner and, being very clever with his fingers,
he had soon set up a perfect statue of a girl about
fourteen years old. This so pleased and quieted him that
he grew quite drowsy, and going back to bed fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But the carpenter was not the only person who lay
awake that night. Thunder was in the air, and the
tailor became so restless that he thought he would go
downstairs and cool his feet in the little fountain outside
the garden door. To reach the door he had to pass
through the room where the carpenter had sat and
smoked, and against the wall he beheld standing a
beautiful girl. He stood speechless for an instant
before he ventured to touch her hand, when, to his
amazement, he found that she was fashioned out of
wood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah! I can make you more beautiful still,&rdquo; said he.
And fetching from a shelf a roll of yellow silk which he
had bought that day from a merchant, he cut and draped
and stitched, till at length a lovely robe clothed the slender
figure. When this was finished, the restlessness had departed
from him, and he went back to bed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As dawn approached the student arose and prepared
to go to the mosque with the first ray of sunlight. But,
when he saw the maiden standing there, he fell on his
knees and lifted his hands in ecstasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air, clad in the
beauty of ten thousand stars,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.
&ldquo;Surely a form so rare was never meant to live without
a soul.&rdquo; And forthwith he prayed with all his might that
life should be breathed into it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And his prayer was heard, and the beautiful statue
became a living girl, and the three men all fell in love with
her, and each desired to have her to wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the nightingale, &lsquo;to which of them did the
maiden really belong? It seems to me that the carpenter
had the best right to her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, but the student would never have thought of praying
that she might be given a soul had not the tailor drawn
attention to her loveliness by the robe which he put upon
her,&rsquo; answered the prince, who guessed what he was expected
to say: and they soon set up quite a pretty quarrel.
Suddenly the princess, furious that neither of them alluded
to the part played by the student, quite forgot her vow of
silence and cried loudly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Idiots that you are! how could she belong to any one
but the student? If it had not been for him, all that the
others did would have gone for nothing! Of course it was
he who married the maiden!&rsquo; And as she spoke the seven
veils fell from her, and she stood up, the fairest princess
that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have won me,&rsquo; she said smiling, holding out her
hand to the prince.</p>

<p>And so they were married: and after the wedding-feast
was over they sent for the old woman whose pitcher the
prince had broken so long ago, and she dwelt in the palace,
and became nurse to their children, and lived happily till
she died.</p>
